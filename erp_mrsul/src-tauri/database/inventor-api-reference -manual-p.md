Parameters Object Page 7 of 16
file:///C:/Users/Cliente/AppData/Local/Temp/~hh4641.htm 16/06/2025
Parameters
Name Type Description
Expression String
Input String value that contains the expression to evaluate. This string is
evaluated the same ways a string entered in any of the Autodesk Inventor
dialogs are evaluated. For example "3 in / 2 cm" is a valid string for input.
UnitsSpecifier Variant
Input variant value that specifies the unit type the expression is to be
evaluated with. You specify a unit type using a value from
UnitsTypeEnum or a string that describes a unit. For example, both of the
following are valid unit specifiers for inch: kInchLengthUnits and "in."
String specifiers are typically used for units that are not defined in the
enum list. For example, the volume measure for cubic inches is not
defined in the enum list but you can specify it using the string "in in in."
Remarks
For example, the string "34 in / 2" with a length unit specifier, will return the value 43.1800. The
UnitsSpecifier is used to determine the type of unit that is expected, (i.e.. area, volume, velocity,
etc.) and is used for values that do not have an explicit type defined. For example the expression
"4 * 5" with a units specifier of "mm mm" would be assumed to be "4 mm * 5 mm." An error
occurs if the string cannot be evaluated. This method is currently not supported when the
UnitsOfMeasure object was obtained using Apprentice. A common use of this method will be to
evaluate an expression using the current display units of the document. For example if the
expression should define a length you can use kDefaultDisplayLengthUnits as the unit specifier so
the expression will be evaluated as a length in the current document units. The enum values that
specify to use the document default display units are kDefaultDisplayLengthUnits,
kDefaultDisplayAngleUnits, kDefaultDisplayMassUnits, kDefaultDisplayTimeUnits, and
kDefaultDisplayTemperatureUnits. The input expression is specified by a string. This string may
or may not specify a unit type (for example, "1" versus "1 in"). In the case where the string
expression does not specify a unit type, the additional unit-type argument is required to determine
the unit type. Note: Up to and including Autodesk Inventor 10, if the string expression does
specify a unit type, the UnitsSpecifier type specified will be ignored because the unit type is
obtained from the string expression. However, subsequent releases of Autodesk Inventor will
return an error condition if the two unit types do not match.

Parameters.IsExpressionValid Method

Returns whether the input expression is valid or not.

Syntax
Parameters.IsExpressionValid( Expression As String, UnitsSpecifier As Variant ) As Boolean
Parameters
Name Type Description
Expression String
Input String value that specifies the equation. This string is evaluated the
same way as strings entered in any of the Inventor dialogs are evaluated.
For example '3 in + 2 cm' is a valid string for input.
UnitsSpecifier Variant
Input value that specifies the type of unit the expression should be
evaluated. The units can be specified using either a string defining a valid
unit or an item from the UnitsTypeEnum. If the equation references
existing parameters, this unit type must be consistent with the unit type
defined by the equation, otherwise an error will occur. If the expression
does specify a unit type, it should match the unit type specified by the
UnitsSpecifier otherwise an error will occur.

Samples
Name Description
Client
Graphics -
Vertex Color
by Z Height
This sample demonstrates using client graphics and some other functions that help to support display control. It uses
the currently active part and replaces the part display with a display where the part's color varies from blue to red
where blue is assigned to the lowest Z portion of the part and red is assigned to the highest Z portion of the part.
Areas in between are represented by a smooth blend of color from blue to red.
Client
Graphics -
Line
This sample demonstrates the creation of custom graphics using LineGraphics and LineStripGraphics. The same set
of coordinate data is used for both types of graphics. Line graphics use two coordinates to define a line, and then the
next two coordinates to define the next line, and so on through the defined coordinates. For the data provided, this
results in gaps in the drawn curve. Line strips use the first two coordinates to define the first line and then the last
point of the first line becomes the first point of the second line and the next coordinate is used as the end point of
the second line. This results in the set of points being connected by a continuous set of lines, drawing a continuous
curve. This sample also demonstrates two methods of defining the color for client graphics. In one case it uses an
existing appearance asset, and in the other, it explicitly defines a color and assigns it. To use the sample you need to
have an assembly or part document open. The program has two behaviors: the first time it is run it will draw the
graphics. The second time it is run it deletes the previously drawn graphics.
Client

and more than one line.
Client
Graphics -
Triangle
This sample demonstrates the creation of client graphics triangles using triange fans and strips. It does this by
drawing a cylinder. The end caps are triangle fans and the cylinder is made from a triangle strip.
3D Curve
from
Parametric
Curve
Demonstrates the conversion of a 2d parameteric space curve into the equivalent 3d model space curve. To use this
sample you must have a part open. You can select any face and 3D curves will be drawn on the face using client
graphics.
Selection of
Surface
This demonstrates the ability to select client graphic primitives, by creating SurfaceGraphics and showing how you
can select B-Rep entities within the graphics. You must have a part or assembly open and select a part of sat file
which will be read in and displayed as client graphics. Depending on our responses to the program it will create the

file:///C:/Users/Cliente/AppData/Local/Temp/~hhCB40.htm 16/06/2025
Parameters
Name Type Description
RayStartPoint Point Input Point object that defines the start point of the ray in model space.
RayDirection UnitVector
Input UnitVector object that defines the direction of the ray. The ray is infinite in the direction
defined.
Radius Double
Input Double that defines the radius of the ray. This value is specified in centimeters. Defining
a radius for a ray allows the intersection to be within a given tolerance. This radius essentially
results in the definition of a cylinder whose axis lies along the axis defined by the
RayStartPoint and RayDirection. The intersection result is between the cylinder and the model's
entities. A value higher than zero is recommended, though not explicitly required.
FoundEntities ObjectsEnumerator Output ObjectsEnumerator that returns the entities that were intersected by the ray.
LocationPoints ObjectsEnumerator
Output ObjectsEnumerator that returns a set of Point objects. One Point object is returned for
each entity in the FoundEntities list. The point defines the coordinate of the intersection
between the ray and the corresponding entity.
FindFirstOnly Boolean
Optional input Boolean that specifies whether to find just the first entity in the ray's path. If
False (the default) then all entities found are returned.
This is an optional argument whose default value is False.
Remarks
There is also a precedence in the type of entities returned. The entities returned can be Vertex, Edge, or Face objects. The
precedence is in that order. If the ray intersects a vertex, then that vertex is returned and none of the edges or faces that connect to
that vertex are returned. If the ray intersects an edge, then that edge is returned and none of the faces that connect to the edge are
returned. If the ray intersects a face, then that face is returned. If desired, you can use the functionality provided by the B-Rep
portion of the API to obtain the various associated objects from the entity returned. For example if you need a face but an edge is
returned, you can use the Faces property of the Edge object to get the associated faces. The start point defines the physical starting
point from which to determine intersections. Any intersections behind the start point are ignored. However, the ray is infinite from
the start point, so all intersections in the direction of the ray will be returned. Note: As of Autodesk Inventor 5.3 Service Pack 2, the
FindUsingRay method has superseded LocateUsingRay. Please update your applications accordingly.

PartDocument Object
Derived from: Document Object
Description
The PartDocument object is derived from the Document object.
Methods
Name Description
Activate Makes this document the active one (receives user-focus).
Close Closes this document.
CreateHighlightSet Method that creates a new highlight set.
FindWhereUsed Method that obtains the set of documents that reference the given file within this document.
GetLocationFoundIn Obtains the name of the location this file was found in.
GetMissingAddInBehavior Method that gets the commands disabled when a particular AddIn is absent.
GetPrivateStorage
Obtains a private sub-storage within this document with the given name. Can create one, if one
does not exist.
GetPrivateStream
Obtains a private stream within this document with the given name. Can create one, if one does
not exist.
GetSelectedObject
In order to provide better handling of system resources Inventor does not load all of the data
when a document is opened but delays loading information until it is needed. A common need in
many programs is to have the user select vertices on parts. Instead of loading the part model in
order to return the true selected Vertex, Inventor returns a GenericObject. You can use this
method to obtain more information about the selected object. If it is a vertex you can get the
point coordinates without forcing the entire model to be loaded, or if you do need to do
additional processing that requires access to the full model you can also force that by using the
"SelectedObject" argument.
HasPrivateStorage Obtains a Boolean flag indicating if the specified sub-storage exists within this document.
HasPrivateStream Obtains a Boolean flag indicating if the specified stream exists within this document.
PutGraphicsLevelsOfDetail
Sets the graphics facet groups that must be saved with this file. Each bit indicating a level of
detail. Up to 6 permitted. File size affected adversely when more. Recommend pick from
GraphicsLevelsOfDetailEnum.

driving entities had been 'dirtied.'
Rebuild2
Method that performs compute operations on all of the entities within this Document's scope as
if all of the driving entities had been 'dirtied'.
ReleaseReference
Method that releases the reference that gets added if a document is opened invisibly through the
API. Releasing the reference on a hidden document makes it a candidate for closure the next
time Inventor closes all unreferenced documents.
RevertReservedForWriteByMe Method that reverts the file checked out by the caller.
Save Saves this document to disk.
Save2 Method that saves the document and the specified dependent documents.
SaveAs Saves this document into a file of the specified name.

PartDocument.GetSelectedObject Method
Parent Object: PartDocument
Description
In order to provide better handling of system resources Inventor does not load all of the data when a document is opened but
delays loading information until it is needed. A common need in many programs is to have the user select vertices on
parts. Instead of loading the part model in order to return the true selected Vertex, Inventor returns a GenericObject. You can use
this method to obtain more information about the selected object. If it is a vertex you can get the point coordinates without forcing
the entire model to be loaded, or if you do need to do additional processing that requires access to the full model you can also
force that by using the "SelectedObject" argument.
Syntax
PartDocument.GetSelectedObject( Selection As GenericObject, ObjectType As ObjectTypeEnum, AdditionalData As
NameValueMap, ContainingOccurrence As ComponentOccurrence, [SelectedObject] As Variant )
Parameters
Name Type Description
Selection GenericObject Input GenericObject that was obtained through a selection.
ObjectType ObjectTypeEnum Output ObjectTypeEnum value that indicates the type of object selected.
AdditionalData NameValueMap
Output NameValueMap object that provides any additional information for the
entity. The following describes the data currently returned.
Object Type Name Value
Vertex Point Point
ContainingOccurrence ComponentOccurrence Output ComponentOccurrence object that contains the entity that was selected.
SelectedObject Variant
Optional output that returns the actual entity that was selected. If this argument is
provided then Inventor will load whatever additional data is required from the
referenced document in order to provide the entity
This is an optional argument whose default value is null.

file:///C:/Users/Cliente/AppData/Local/Temp/~hh27B8.htm 16/06/2025
Client
Graphics -
Vertex
Color by Z
Height
This sample demonstrates using client graphics and some other functions that help to support display control. It uses
the currently active part and replaces the part display with a display where the part's color varies from blue to red
where blue is assigned to the lowest Z portion of the part and red is assigned to the highest Z portion of the part.
Areas in between are represented by a smooth blend of color from blue to red.
Client
Graphics -
Line
This sample demonstrates the creation of custom graphics using LineGraphics and LineStripGraphics. The same set
of coordinate data is used for both types of graphics. Line graphics use two coordinates to define a line, and then the
next two coordinates to define the next line, and so on through the defined coordinates. For the data provided, this
results in gaps in the drawn curve. Line strips use the first two coordinates to define the first line and then the last
point of the first line becomes the first point of the second line and the next coordinate is used as the end point of the
second line. This results in the set of points being connected by a continuous set of lines, drawing a continuous
curve. This sample also demonstrates two methods of defining the color for client graphics. In one case it uses an
existing appearance asset, and in the other, it explicitly defines a color and assigns it. To use the sample you need to
have an assembly or part document open. The program has two behaviors: the first time it is run it will draw the
graphics. The second time it is run it deletes the previously drawn graphics.
Client
Graphics -
Triangle
This sample demonstrates the creation of client graphics triangles using triange fans and strips. It does this by
drawing a cylinder. The end caps are triangle fans and the cylinder is made from a triangle strip.

open the file if not already open and obtain a Document
object. Typically you'll want to set the OpenVisible
argument of the Open method to False so the open is
invisible to the user.
PlacementPoint Point2d
Input Point2d that specifies the placement point of the
parts list on the sheet.
Level PartsListLevelEnum
Optional input enum that sets the type of numbering for
the parts list. If supplied, this input is only used in the
case where the ParentView references an assembly file.
If this value was previously set on the parent drawing
view as a result of creating a parts list or a balloon based
on the view, this argument is ignored. Valid enums are:
kFirstLevelComponents, that creates a parts list in
which subassemblies are assigned nested numbering (for
example, 1, 1.1, 1.1.1) and the nested number extends as
many levels as needed for the assembly levels in the
model and kPartsOnly, that creates a parts list that
sequentially numbers all parts in the top level assembly,
even if they are contained in subassemblies.
This is an optional argument whose default value is
46593.
NumberingScheme Variant Optional input NameValueMap object that specifies the
numbering scheme to use for the parts list. The
NameValueMap can contain the following entries based
on the input 'Level' argument: * For kStructured:
MinimumDigits As Long * For kStructuredAllLevels:
Delimiter As String * For kPartsOnly:
NumberingScheme As NumberingSchemeEnum and
MinimumDigits As Long Valid values for
NumberingSchemeEnum are kNumericNumbering,
kLowercaseAlphaNumbering and
PartsLists Object Page 2 of 5
file:///C:/Users/Cliente/AppData/Local/Temp/~hhA7BC.htm 16/06/2025

supplied only if the input argument Level is specified to
be kPartsOnly. If this argument is not supplied for a
'parts only' parts list, a default value of
kNumericNumbering is assumed.
This is an optional argument whose default value is null.
NumberOfSections Long
Optional input long that specifies the number of sections
desired in the parts list. If supplied, this input is only
used in the case where the ParentView references an
assembly file. The default value is 1.
This is an optional argument whose default value is 1.
WrapLeft Boolean
Optional input Boolean that specifies whether to move
the sections to the left or the right when the number of
rows increase. If supplied, this input is only used in the
case where the ParentView references an assembly file.
The default value is true, indicating that sections will be
moved to the left.
This is an optional argument whose default value is
True.

CopyContentsTo
Method that copies all the contents of the sketch to the \input target
sketch.
CopyEntitiesTo
Method that copies sketch entities of the sketch to the input target
sketch.
Delete
Method that deletes the sketch. This method is only valid for
sketches that are not used by a feature.
Edit
Method that causes the Sketch environment to be invoked with this
sketch available for interactive edit.
ExitEdit
Causes the Sketch environment to be closed and the user interface
to return to the previous environment. This is equivalent to the
Return command. This method is only valid in the case where this
sketch is open for edit within the user interface.
GetCustomLineType
Method that returns information regarding the custom line type in
use. The method returns a failure if the return value of the LineType
property is not kCustomLineType.
GetReferenceKey Method that generates and returns the reference key for this entity.
ModelToSketchSpace
Method that takes a 3D coordinate in model space, projects it onto
the sketch plane along the normal of the plane and returns a Point2d
object containing the resulting coordinate point in sketch space.
MoveSketchObjects
PlanarSketch Object Page 1 of 53
file:///C:/Users/Cliente/AppData/Local/Temp/~hh723B.htm 16/06/2025
Method that moves a collection of sketch objects by a specified
vector. If the Copy argument is set to True, the newly created
objects are returned.
OffsetSketchEntitiesUsingDistance
Method that offsets a sketch entity or a group of connected sketch
entities. In both cases, the base sketch entity is first offset by the
specified distance and along the specified direction. The base sketch
entity is determined as follows: * If only one sketch entity needs to
be offset, it will be treated as the base sketch entity. * If a group of
end-to-end connected entities need to be offset, the first entity in the
group will be treated as the base sketch entity. If this method
successfully offsets the specified input sketch entities, the newly
created sketch entities are returned.
OffsetSketchEntitiesUsingPoint
Method that offsets a sketch entity or a group of end-to-end
connected sketch entities. In both cases, the offset is first applied to
the base sketch entity such that the offset of the base sketch entity
passes through the specified offset point on the sketch. The shortest
distance of this offset point from the original base sketch entity
determines the offset distance.
RotateSketchObjects
Method that rotates a collection of sketch objects by a specified
angle. If the Copy argument is set to True, the newly created objects
are returned.
SetCustomLineType
Method that sets a custom line type to the curve from the
specified .lin file. The method automatically changes the value of
LineType property to kCustomLineType.
SetEndOfPart
Method that repositions the end-of-part marker relative to the object
this method is called from. The argument defines if the end-of-part
marker will be positioned just before or just after the object. If the
object is contained within another object and is not in the top level
of the browser, the positioning of the marker will be relative to the
top-level object the calling object is contained within. An example
of this case is a sketch that has not been shared and has been
consumed by a feature. Another example is a nested work feature.
SketchToModelSpace
Method that takes a 2D coordinate in sketch space, and returns a
Point3d containing the coordinates of the point in model space.
Solve Method that causes the sketch to solve.
UpdateProfiles Method that updates all the profiles within the sketch.

Method

Description
Method that offsets a sketch entity or a group of connected sketch entities. In both cases, the base sketch
entity is first offset by the specified distance and along the specified direction. The base sketch entity is

entity. * If a group of end-to-end connected entities need to be offset, the first entity in the group will be
treated as the base sketch entity. If this method successfully offsets the specified input sketch entities, the
newly created sketch entities are returned.

[CreateOffsetConstraints] As Boolean ) As SketchEntitiesEnumerator
PlanarSketch Object Page 29 of 53
file:///C:/Users/Cliente/AppData/Local/Temp/~hh723B.htm 16/06/2025
Parameters
Name Type Description
SketchEntities ObjectCollection
ObjectCollection that specifies either a single sketch entity
or a set of sketch entities that need to be offset. The
collection can contain any SketchEntity object except
SketchPoint because sketch points cannot be offset. The
first entity in the collection is always treated as the base
sketch entity. The offset distance (OffsetDistance
argument) and the offset direction (NaturalOffsetDirection
argument) apply to this base sketch entity. If only one
sketch entity needs to be offset, then it should be specified
as the only item in the collection and the
IncludeConnectedEntities argument should be specified as
False. Since the entity specified in the collection is the first
and only item in the collection, it will be treated as the base
sketch entity. If a group of end-to-end connected sketch
entities need to be offset, then they can be specified using
one of the following options: * Specifying an exact set of
sketch entities to offset. The collection can be used to
specify an exact set of sketch entities that need to be offset.
The objects in the collection must represent entities that are
end-to-end connected and the collection must contain the
objects in the order that they are connected. The first entity
specified in the collection will be treated as the base sketch
entity. * Specifying only the base sketch entity and
automatically including connected entities. The base sketch
entity should be specified as the only item in the collection.
The IncludeConnectedEntities boolean argument should be
specified as True to indicate that all entities that form a loop
(open or closed) which contains the base sketch entity
should be automatically included to be offset. Since only
one of the above options to specify a group of connected
entities can be used at the same time and not both, if the
collection contains multiple entities, it implies that the
collection is being used to explicitly specify an exact set of
sketch entities to offset, in which case the
IncludeConnectedEntities argument should be False. If
True is specified, the method will fail and the sketch
entities will not be offset.
OffsetDistance Double Specifies the offset distance for the base sketch entity (the
sketch entity specified by the first item in the SketchEntities
collection). Since a group of connected entities that need to
be offset will all be offset by the same distance, it implies
that the distance value specified by this argument will be
used not only for the base sketch entity but also for all the
remaining connected sketch entities. Since the offset of the
base sketch entity can lie on either side of the base entity,
the offset distance in itself does not provide sufficient
information regarding the final position for the offset of the
base sketch entity. The NaturalOffsetDirection boolean
argument can be used to specify one out of the two possible
offset directions for the base sketch entity. Thus, the offset
distance specified by this argument and the offset direction
specified by the NaturalOffsetDirection boolean argument
PlanarSketch Object Page 30 of 53
file:///C:/Users/Cliente/AppData/Local/Temp/~hh723B.htm 16/06/2025
together determine the final position for the offset of the
base sketch entity. Once the offset position for the base
sketch entity is determined, the offset positions for any
other additional connected sketch entities can be inferred.
NaturalOffsetDirection Boolean
Value that can be used to specify one out of the two
possible offset directions. This argument applies to the base
sketch entity (the sketch entity specified by the first item in
the SketchEntities collection). The natural offset direction is
along the natural normal direction at any point on the base
sketch entity which in-turn is defined as the cross-product
of the vector representing the tangent at that point and the
vector representing the sketch normal. If True is specified,
then the points on the offset of the base sketch entity will be
positioned in the direction specified by the natural normal
at the corresponding points on the original base sketch
entity. If False is specified, then the offset of the base
sketch entity will be positioned in the direction opposite to
that of the natural normal. Thus, this argument determines
on which side of the base sketch entity the offset of the base
sketch entity will be placed. Since this argument specifies
only the offset direction, the OffsetDistance argument has
to be used to specify the offset distance along the offset
direction specified by this argument. Thus, the offset
direction specified by this argument and the offset distance
specified by the OffsetDistance argument together
determine the final position for the offset of the base sketch
entity. Once the offset position for the base sketch entity is
determined, the offset positions for any other additional
connected sketch entities can be inferred.
IncludeConnectedEntities Boolean
Value that specifies whether all entities that form a loop
containing the base sketch entity should also be offset. If
True is specified, then all loop entities will be offset. But, if
the sketch has multiple loops that contain the base sketch
entity in which case it will not be possible to uniquely
determine a single loop that needs to be offset, only the
base sketch entity will be offset. If False is specified, then
only the entities specified in the SketchEntities collection
will be offset. If True is specified, the SketchEntities
collection should contain only one item that corresponds to
the base sketch entity, otherwise, if the SketchEntities
collection contains multiple entities, then this method will
fail and the sketch entities will not be offset. If False is
specified, the SketchEntities collection can contain either a
single item that corresponds to the base sketch entity or
multiple items that correspond to a group of end-to-end
connected entities. If the collection contains a single item
that corresponds to the base sketch entity, then only this
base sketch entity will be offset. On the other hand, if the
collection contains multiple items, it implies that the
collection is being used to specify an exact set of sketch
entities to offset, hence, only those exact set of sketch
entities will be offset. If no value is specified for this
argument, then a default value of False will be assumed.
This is an optional argument whose default value is False.

file:///C:/Users/Cliente/AppData/Local/Temp/~hh723B.htm 16/06/2025
CreateOffsetConstraints Boolean Value that specifies whether offset constraints between the
original and offset entities should be automatically created.
If True is specified, then offset constraints will be
automatically created. If False is specified, then offset
constraints will not be created. If no value is specified, then
a default value of True will be assumed to indicate that the
offset constraints will be automatically created.
This is an optional argument whose default value is True.

PlanarSketch.OffsetSketchEntitiesUsingPoint
Method
Parent Object: PlanarSketch
Description
Method that offsets a sketch entity or a group of end-to-end connected sketch entities. In both cases, the
offset is first applied to the base sketch entity such that the offset of the base sketch entity passes through
the specified offset point on the sketch. The shortest distance of this offset point from the original base
sketch entity determines the offset distance.
Syntax
PlanarSketch.OffsetSketchEntitiesUsingPoint( SketchEntities As ObjectCollection, OffsetPoint As
Point2d, [IncludeConnectedEntities] As Boolean, [CreateOffsetConstraints] As Boolean ) As
SketchEntitiesEnumerator
Parameters
Name Type Description
SketchEntities ObjectCollection ObjectCollection that specifies either a single sketch entity
or a set of sketch entities that need to be offset. The
collection can contain any SketchEntity object except
SketchPoint because sketch points cannot be offset. The
first entity in the collection is always treated as the base
sketch entity. The offset distance (OffsetDistance
argument) and the offset direction (NaturalOffsetDirection
argument) apply to this base sketch entity. If only one
sketch entity needs to be offset, then it should be specified
as the only item in the collection and the
IncludeConnectedEntities argument should be specified as
False. Since the entity specified in the collection is the first
and only item in the collection, it will be treated as the base
sketch entity. If a group of end\-to\-end connected sketch
entities need to be offset, then they can be specified using
PlanarSketch Object Page 32 of 53
file:///C:/Users/Cliente/AppData/Local/Temp/~hh723B.htm 16/06/2025
one of the following options\: * Specifying an exact set of
sketch entities to offset. The collection can be used to
specify an exact set of sketch entities that need to be offset.
The objects in the collection must represent entities that are
end-to-end connected and the collection must contain the
objects in the order that they are connected. The first entity
specified in the collection will be treated as the base sketch
entity. * Specifying only the base sketch entity and
automatically including connected entities. The base sketch
entity should be specified as the only item in the collection.
The IncludeConnectedEntities boolean argument should be
specified as True to indicate that all entities that form a loop
(open or closed) which contains the base sketch entity
should be automatically included to be offset.
Since only one of the above options to specify a group of
connected entities can be used at the same time and not
both, if the collection contains multiple entities, it implies
that the collection is being used to explicitly specify an
exact set of sketch entities to offset, in which case the
IncludeConnectedEntities argument should be False. If
True is specified, the method will fail and the sketch
entities will not be offset.
OffsetPoint Point2d
Defines a point on the sketch through which the offset of
the base sketch entity (the sketch entity specified by the
first item in the SketchEntities collection) should pass. The
shortest distance of this point from the base sketch entity is
used to determine the offset distance. This offset distance
will also be used to offset any other additional connected
sketch entities. The location of the point with respect to the
base sketch entity determines the position of the offset base
sketch entity (i.e. the location of the point determines on
which side of the base sketch entity the offset of the base
sketch entity will be positioned). Once the offset distance
and position for the offset of the base sketch entity are
determined, this information is used to determine the
position for all other connected sketch entities that need to
be offset. Thus, the offset point provides sufficient
information to calculate the offset distance as well as the
offset direction for all the sketch entities that need to be
offset.
IncludeConnectedEntities Boolean Value that specifies whether all entities that form a loop
containing the base sketch entity should also be offset. If
True is specified, then all loop entities will be offset. But, if
the sketch has multiple loops that contain the base sketch
entity in which case it will not be possible to uniquely
determine a single loop that needs to be offset, only the
base sketch entity will be offset. If False is specified, then
only the entities specified in the SketchEntities collection
will be offset. If True is specified, the SketchEntities
collection should contain only one item that corresponds to
the base sketch entity, otherwise, if the SketchEntities
collection contains multiple entities, then this method will
fail and the sketch entities will not be offset. If False is
PlanarSketch Object Page 33 of 53
file:///C:/Users/Cliente/AppData/Local/Temp/~hh723B.htm 16/06/2025
specified, the SketchEntities collection can contain either a
single item that corresponds to the base sketch entity or
multiple items that correspond to a group of end\-to\-end
connected entities. If the collection contains a single item
that corresponds to the base sketch entity, then only this
base sketch entity will be offset. On the other hand, if the
collection contains multiple items, it implies that the
collection is being used to specify an exact set of sketch
entities to offset, hence, only those exact set of sketch
entities will be offset. If no value is specified for this
argument, then a default value of False will be assumed.
This is an optional argument whose default value is False.
CreateOffsetConstraints Boolean
Value that specifies whether offset constraints between the
original and offset entities should be automatically created.
If True is specified, then offset constraints will be
automatically created. If False is specified, then offset
constraints will not be created. If no value is specified, then
a default value of True will be assumed to indicate that the
offset constraints will be automatically created.
This is an optional argument whose default value is True.

SketchEntity object except SketchPoint because sketch points cannot be
offset. The first entity in the collection is always treated as the base
sketch entity. The offset distance (OffsetDistance argument) and the
offset direction (NaturalOffsetDirection argument) apply to this base
sketch entity. If only one sketch entity needs to be offset, then it should
be specified as the only item in the collection and the
IncludeConnectedEntities argument should be specified as False. Since
the entity specified in the collection is the first and only item in the
collection, it will be treated as the base sketch entity. If a group of endto-
end connected sketch entities need to be offset, then they can be
specified using one of the following options: * Specifying an exact set of
sketch entities to offset. The collection can be used to specify an exact
set of sketch entities that need to be offset. The objects in the collection
must represent entities that are end-to-end connected and the collection
must contain the objects in the order that they are connected. The first
entity specified in the collection will be treated as the base sketch entity.
* Specifying only the base sketch entity and automatically including
connected entities. The base sketch entity should be specified as the only
item in the collection. The IncludeConnectedEntities boolean argument
PlanarSketchProxy Object Page 24 of 42
file:///C:/Users/Cliente/AppData/Local/Temp/~hhE548.htm 16/06/2025
should be specified as True to indicate that all entities that form a loop
(open or closed) which contains the base sketch entity should be
automatically included to be offset. Since only one of the above options
to specify a group of connected entities can be used at the same time and
not both, if the collection contains multiple entities, it implies that the
collection is being used to explicitly specify an exact set of sketch
entities to offset, in which case the IncludeConnectedEntities argument
should be False. If True is specified, the method will fail and the sketch
entities will not be offset.
OffsetDistance Double
Specifies the offset distance for the base sketch entity (the sketch entity
specified by the first item in the SketchEntities collection). Since a
group of connected entities that need to be offset will all be offset by the
same distance, it implies that the distance value specified by this
argument will be used not only for the base sketch entity but also for all
the remaining connected sketch entities. Since the offset of the base
sketch entity can lie on either side of the base entity, the offset distance
in itself does not provide sufficient information regarding the final
position for the offset of the base sketch entity. The
NaturalOffsetDirection boolean argument can be used to specify one out
of the two possible offset directions for the base sketch entity. Thus, the
offset distance specified by this argument and the offset direction
specified by the NaturalOffsetDirection boolean argument together
determine the final position for the offset of the base sketch entity. Once
the offset position for the base sketch entity is determined, the offset
positions for any other additional connected sketch entities can be
inferred.
NaturalOffsetDirection Boolean
Value that can be used to specify one out of the two possible offset
directions. This argument applies to the base sketch entity (the sketch
entity specified by the first item in the SketchEntities collection). The
natural offset direction is along the natural normal direction at any point
on the base sketch entity which in-turn is defined as the cross-product of
the vector representing the tangent at that point and the vector
representing the sketch normal. If True is specified, then the points on
the offset of the base sketch entity will be positioned in the direction
specified by the natural normal at the corresponding points on the
original base sketch entity. If False is specified, then the offset of the
base sketch entity will be positioned in the direction opposite to that of
the natural normal. Thus, this argument determines on which side of the
base sketch entity the offset of the base sketch entity will be placed.
Since this argument specifies only the offset direction, the
OffsetDistance argument has to be used to specify the offset distance
along the offset direction specified by this argument. Thus, the offset
direction specified by this argument and the offset distance specified by
the OffsetDistance argument together determine the final position for the
offset of the base sketch entity. Once the offset position for the base
sketch entity is determined, the offset positions for any other additional
connected sketch entities can be inferred.
IncludeConnectedEntities Boolean Value that specifies whether all entities that form a loop containing the
base sketch entity should also be offset. If True is specified, then all loop
entities will be offset. But, if the sketch has multiple loops that contain
the base sketch entity in which case it will not be possible to uniquely
determine a single loop that needs to be offset, only the base sketch
entity will be offset. If False is specified, then only the entities specified
in the SketchEntities collection will be offset. If True is specified, the
SketchEntities collection should contain only one item that corresponds
to the base sketch entity, otherwise, if the SketchEntities collection
contains multiple entities, then this method will fail and the sketch
entities will not be offset. If False is specified, the SketchEntities
collection can contain either a single item that corresponds to the base
sketch entity or multiple items that correspond to a group of end-to-end
connected entities. If the collection contains a single item that
corresponds to the base sketch entity, then only this base sketch entity
PlanarSketchProxy Object Page 25 of 42
file:///C:/Users/Cliente/AppData/Local/Temp/~hhE548.htm 16/06/2025
will be offset. On the other hand, if the collection contains multiple
items, it implies that the collection is being used to specify an exact set
of sketch entities to offset, hence, only those exact set of sketch entities
will be offset. If no value is specified for this argument, then a default
value of False will be assumed.
This is an optional argument whose default value is False.
CreateOffsetConstraints Boolean
Value that specifies whether offset constraints between the original and
offset entities should be automatically created. If True is specified, then
offset constraints will be automatically created. If False is specified, then
offset constraints will not be created. If no value is specified, then a
default value of True will be assumed to indicate that the offset
constraints will be automatically created.
This is an optional argument whose default value is True.

PlanarSketchProxy.OffsetSketchEntitiesUsingPoint
Method
Parent Object: PlanarSketchProxy
Description
Method that offsets a sketch entity or a group of end-to-end connected sketch entities. In both cases, the offset is first
applied to the base sketch entity such that the offset of the base sketch entity passes through the specified offset point
on the sketch. The shortest distance of this offset point from the original base sketch entity determines the offset
distance.
Syntax
PlanarSketchProxy.OffsetSketchEntitiesUsingPoint( SketchEntities As ObjectCollection, OffsetPoint As Point2d,
[IncludeConnectedEntities] As Boolean, [CreateOffsetConstraints] As Boolean ) As SketchEntitiesEnumerator
Parameters
Name Type Description
SketchEntities ObjectCollection ObjectCollection that specifies either a single sketch entity or a set of
sketch entities that need to be offset. The collection can contain any
SketchEntity object except SketchPoint because sketch points cannot be
offset. The first entity in the collection is always treated as the base
sketch entity. The offset distance (OffsetDistance argument) and the
offset direction (NaturalOffsetDirection argument) apply to this base
sketch entity. If only one sketch entity needs to be offset, then it should
be specified as the only item in the collection and the
IncludeConnectedEntities argument should be specified as False. Since
the entity specified in the collection is the first and only item in the
collection, it will be treated as the base sketch entity. If a group of
end\-to\-end connected sketch entities need to be offset, then they can be
specified using one of the following options\: * Specifying an exact set
of sketch entities to offset. The collection can be used to specify an exact
set of sketch entities that need to be offset. The objects in the collection
must represent entities that are end-to-end connected and the collection
PlanarSketchProxy Object Page 26 of 42
file:///C:/Users/Cliente/AppData/Local/Temp/~hhE548.htm 16/06/2025
must contain the objects in the order that they are connected. The first
entity specified in the collection will be treated as the base sketch entity.
* Specifying only the base sketch entity and automatically including
connected entities. The base sketch entity should be specified as the only
item in the collection. The IncludeConnectedEntities boolean argument
should be specified as True to indicate that all entities that form a loop
(open or closed) which contains the base sketch entity should be
automatically included to be offset.
Since only one of the above options to specify a group of connected
entities can be used at the same time and not both, if the collection
contains multiple entities, it implies that the collection is being used to
explicitly specify an exact set of sketch entities to offset, in which case
the IncludeConnectedEntities argument should be False. If True is
specified, the method will fail and the sketch entities will not be offset.
OffsetPoint Point2d
Defines a point on the sketch through which the offset of the base sketch
entity (the sketch entity specified by the first item in the SketchEntities
collection) should pass. The shortest distance of this point from the base
sketch entity is used to determine the offset distance. This offset distance
will also be used to offset any other additional connected sketch entities.
The location of the point with respect to the base sketch entity
determines the position of the offset base sketch entity (i.e. the location
of the point determines on which side of the base sketch entity the offset
of the base sketch entity will be positioned). Once the offset distance and
position for the offset of the base sketch entity are determined, this
information is used to determine the position for all other connected
sketch entities that need to be offset. Thus, the offset point provides
sufficient information to calculate the offset distance as well as the offset
direction for all the sketch entities that need to be offset.
IncludeConnectedEntities Boolean
Value that specifies whether all entities that form a loop containing the
base sketch entity should also be offset. If True is specified, then all loop
entities will be offset. But, if the sketch has multiple loops that contain
the base sketch entity in which case it will not be possible to uniquely
determine a single loop that needs to be offset, only the base sketch
entity will be offset. If False is specified, then only the entities specified
in the SketchEntities collection will be offset. If True is specified, the
SketchEntities collection should contain only one item that corresponds
to the base sketch entity, otherwise, if the SketchEntities collection
contains multiple entities, then this method will fail and the sketch
entities will not be offset. If False is specified, the SketchEntities
collection can contain either a single item that corresponds to the base
sketch entity or multiple items that correspond to a group of end\-to\-end
connected entities. If the collection contains a single item that
corresponds to the base sketch entity, then only this base sketch entity
will be offset. On the other hand, if the collection contains multiple
items, it implies that the collection is being used to specify an exact set
of sketch entities to offset, hence, only those exact set of sketch entities
will be offset. If no value is specified for this argument, then a default
value of False will be assumed.
This is an optional argument whose default value is False.
CreateOffsetConstraints Boolean Value that specifies whether offset constraints between the original and
offset entities should be automatically created. If True is specified, then
offset constraints will be automatically created. If False is specified, then
offset constraints will not be created. If no value is specified, then a
default value of True will be assumed to indicate that the offset
constraints will be automatically created.

Syntax
PresentationFace.GetExistingFacets( ToleranceIndex As Double, VertexCount As Long, FacetCount As
Long, VertexCoordinates() As Double, NormalVectors() As Double, VertexIndices() As Long )
Parameters
Name Type Description
ToleranceIndex Double
Input Double that serves as an index as to which set of existing facets you want to
retrieve. If the input tolerance does not match an existing set an error will occur.
The tolerances for existing facets can be obtained using the
GetExistingFacetTolerances method.
VertexCount Long
Output Long that returns the number of vertices that were generated. This is the
number of vertices that will be returned by the VertexCoordinates argument.
FacetCount Long Output Long that returns the number of facets that were generated.
VertexCoordinates Double
Output array of Doubles that contains the coordinate locations of the vertices. The
values are defined in x, y, z order within the array and represent coordinates within
the model space of the faceted object.
NormalVectors Double
Output array of Doubles that defines the normal for each vertex in the facet mesh.
The values are defined in x, y, z order within the array and represent vector
components within the model space of the faceted object.
VertexIndices Long
Output array of Longs that are used as index values to index into the vertex
coordinate list. The first coordinate in the vertex coordinate list is index 1. Using
vertex indices allows vertex coordinates to be reused by more than one triangle,
thus reducing the overall resources required to define the entire mesh.

SurfaceBody Copy
This sample demonstrates copying a surface body from one part to
another. This is equivalent to the Promote command, but the API is
much more flexible. In order for the sample to be self-contained, it
creates two parts on the fly that will be used to demonstrate copying a
body from one part to another. When copying a body into a part, you
provide the surface body and a matrix to define its position in the new
part. This sample creates a matrix based on the position of these parts
within an assembly.

This sample demonstrates copying a surface body from one part to another.
This is equivalent to the Promote command, but the API is much more flexible.
In order for the sample to be self-contained, it creates two parts on the fly that
will be used to demonstrate copying a body from one part to another. When
copying a body into a part, you provide the surface body and a matrix to define
its position in the new part. This sample creates a matrix based on the position
of these parts within an assembly.

As Variant ) As Profile
Profiles Object Page 2 of 8
file:///C:/Users/Cliente/AppData/Local/Temp/~hhA319.htm 16/06/2025
Parameters
Name Type Description
Combine Boolean
Optional input Boolean that specifies whether to combine the
profile paths obtained when this method is used to create a new
profile. For instance, let us take the example of a sketch containing
two concentric circles. If this argument is specified to be true, the
resulting profile will contain 2 profile paths, and the profile path
corresponding to the inner circle will have its AddsMaterial flag
set to False. Hence, the resulting profile is a circular disc with a
circular cut\-out. If the Combine flag is specified to be False, the
resulting profile will contain 2 profile paths with the AddsMaterial
flag set to True for both paths. If the sketch contains text boxes,
then the profile paths corresponding to them will always have the
AddsMaterial flag set to True irrespective of whether the Combine
flag is specified to be True or False.
This is an optional argument whose default value is True.
ProfilePathSegments Variant
Optional input ObjectCollection that can contain sketch curves as
well as text boxes. If sketch curves are specified, then the profile
created by this method will include profile paths that are
comprised of the exact set of sketch curves specified in the
ObjectCollection. If text boxes are specified, then the profile
created by this method will include profile paths that correspond to
the exact set of text boxes specified in the ObjectCollection. Each
text box in the collection will correspond to a unique profile path.
If not specified, all the possible profile paths including sketch
curves as well as text boxes will be included. This argument is
ignored if the Combine argument is specified to be True.
This is an optional argument whose default value is null.
Reserved Variant
Optional input Variant reserved for future use. This argument is
currently ignored.
This is an optional argument whose default value is null.
Remarks
If sketch curves are included in the profile, the topological information defined by the intersection
and connection of sketch entities with one another is used to define the various profile paths. A
profile path consists of one or more profile entities. If a profile path contains only one profile
entity, then it implies that a single sketch curve (e.g. a sketch circle) defines the profile path. If the
profile path comprises of multiple profile entities, then a set of connected sketch curves defines
the profile path with each profile entity representing an entire sketch curve or a portion of it. If
text boxes are included in the profile, then each text box will be associated with a single profile
Profiles Object Page 3 of 8
file:///C:/Users/Cliente/AppData/Local/Temp/~hhA319.htm 16/06/2025
path. Since a single instance of a text box that contains some text essentially consists of a group of
one or more characters which have a certain thickness, the outline of each character in the text can
be considered to form a closed loop. All the characters in a given text box will be treated as a
single entity and grouped to form a single profile path. The profile paths defined by the sketch
curves will be independently determined from the profile paths defined by the text boxes. The
sketch curves will be evaluated based on their topological information to define a set of profile
paths that comprises of only the sketch curves. The text boxes will be used to define a different set
of profile paths such that each text box will correspond to a unique profile path. Therefore, a given
profile path will either include sketch curves or a single text box but not both.

Method
Parent Object: PunchToolFeatures
Description
Method that creates a new iFeatureDefinition.
Syntax

Parameters
Name Type Description
FullFileName String
Input string that specifies the name of the iFeature file (.ide) to create the
definition for. The file must be an existing iFeature file. If an invalid file is
specified an error will occur.
Remarks
The returned definition provides access to all of the inputs that are necessary for placing a punch
feature. Using this object you provide the parameter and the geometry inputs necessary for placing
the punch feature. Creating an iFeatureDefinition for use as input to create a punch tool feature
(using the PunchToolFeatures.CreateiFeatureDefinition method results in an iFeatureDefinition
that is slightly different than when created for a standard iFeature (using the
iFeatures.CreateiFeatureDefinition method). For a punch tool iFeatureDefinition there is not a
sketch plane input since the sketch plane is inferred by using the parent sketch of the input sketch
points.
