Parameters
Name Type Description
EntityOne Object
Input object that defines the first object. This object
can be a planar face, work plane, linear edge, work
axis, or a face that defines an axis.
EntityTwo Object
Input object that defines the second object. This object
can be a planar face, work plane, linear edge, work
axis, or a face that defines an axis.
Angle Variant
Input Variant that defines the angle between the two
input entities. This can be either a numeric value or a
string. A parameter for this value is created and the
supplied string or value is assigned to the parameter. If
a value is input, the units are radians. If a string is
input the units can be specified as part of the string or
will default to the current angle units of the document.
SolutionType AngleConstraintSolutionTypeEnum
Optional input AngleConstraintSolutionTypeEnum
that specifies the solution type. If specified to be
kDirectedSolution, the solution always applies the
right hand rule. If specified to be kUndirectedSolution,
the solution allows either orientation, thus resolving
situations where component orientation flips during a
constraint drive or drag. If specified to be
kReferenceVectorSolution, the ReferenceVectorEntity
argument must be provided with a third entity for the
solution. The default value is kDirectedSolution.
This is an optional argument whose default value is
78593.
ReferenceVectorEntity Variant
Optional input object that provides a third entity to
solve the angle constraint. This argument is ignored if
the SolutionType argument is not
kReferenceVectorSolution. This object can be a planar
face, work plane, linear edge, work axis, or a face that
defines an axis.
This is an optional argument whose default value is
null.
BiasPointOne Variant Optional input Point object that is used help in
determining the initial position of the occurrence. The
occurrences are repositioned in an attempt to make the
AngleConstraint Object Page 6 of 32
file:///C:/Users/Cliente/AppData/Local/Temp/~hh46CF.htm 13/06/2025
two bias points coincident. This provides some general
control over the position of the occurrence when it isn't
being controlled by another constraint. An example of
when the bias points are useful is the case when the
first constraint on a part is a mate constraint. In the
case where the mate is between two planes, the parts
can be positioned anywhere along the infinite plane
that defines their mating contact. Using the bias points
you can define the position of the two occurrences,
relative to each other. If a bias point is not given, one
is calculated that is at the center of the parameter range
of the input entity.
This is an optional argument whose default value is
null.
BiasPointTwo Variant
Optional input Point object that is used help in
determining the initial position of the occurrence. The

An example of when the bias points are useful is the case when the first constraint on a part
is a mate constraint. In the case where the mate is between two planes, the parts can be
positioned anywhere along the infinite plane that defines their mating contact. Using the
bias points you can define the position of the two occurrences, relative to each other.
If a bias point is not given, one is calculated that is at the center of the parameter range of
the input entity.
This is an optional argument whose default value is null.

Parameters
Name Type Description
Camera Camera
Input Camera object that specifies the view orientation. This can either be a transient Camera object or that got
from View object etc.. And the camera properties can be changed but not applied.
GroupCount Long
Output Long that indicates the number of groups. A group is a set of related polylines where there can be one
outer and multiple inner polylines. Groups can optionally also be filled.
PolylinesPerGroup Long
Output array of Longs that indicates the number of polylines in each of the groups. The array size will be
GroupCount where each value of this array indicates the number of polylines within each group.
When reading the polylines within a group, the first polyline is the outer polyline and any additional closed
polylines represent internal voids if the group is filled.
FilledGroups Boolean
Output array of Booleans that indicates which groups are filled. A value of True indicates the corresponding
group is filled. The array size will be GroupCount. If a group is filled, the first polyline in the group defines the
outer loop. Any other polylines for that group represent internal loops and voids in the fill.

Drive the
camera
This sample will fly the camera around the model. To simplify the code, the target is hard
coded at the origin and the up vector is the positive Z.
Client
Graphics -
Vertex
Color by Z
Height
This sample demonstrates using client graphics and some other functions that help to support
display control. It uses the currently active part and replaces the part display with a display
where the part's color varies from blue to red where blue is assigned to the lowest Z portion of
the part and red is assigned to the highest Z portion of the part. Areas in between are
represented by a smooth blend of color from blue to red.
Client
Graphics -
Line
This sample demonstrates the creation of custom graphics using LineGraphics and
LineStripGraphics. The same set of coordinate data is used for both types of graphics. Line
graphics use two coordinates to define a line, and then the next two coordinates to define the
next line, and so on through the defined coordinates. For the data provided, this results in gaps
in the drawn curve. Line strips use the first two coordinates to define the first line and then the
last point of the first line becomes the first point of the second line and the next coordinate is
used as the end point of the second line. This results in the set of points being connected by a
continuous set of lines, drawing a continuous curve. This sample also demonstrates two
methods of defining the color for client graphics. In one case it uses an existing appearance
asset, and in the other, it explicitly defines a color and assigns it. To use the sample you need to
have an assembly or part document open. The program has two behaviors: the first time it is
run it will draw the graphics. The second time it is run it deletes the previously drawn graphics.
Client
Graphics -
Triangle
This sample demonstrates the creation of client graphics triangles using triange fans and strips.
It does this by drawing a cylinder. The end caps are triangle fans and the cylinder is made from
a triangle strip.

Client graphics
from SAT file
body
The following sample demonstrates how to display client graphics based on bodies read in
from a SAT file.
3D Curve from
Parametric
Curve
Demonstrates the conversion of a 2d parameteric space curve into the equivalent 3d
model space curve. To use this sample you must have a part open. You can select any face
and 3D curves will be drawn on the face using client graphics.
Selection of
Surface
Graphics
Primitives
This demonstrates the ability to select client graphic primitives, by creating
SurfaceGraphics and showing how you can select B-Rep entities within the graphics. You
must have a part or assembly open and select a part of sat file which will be read in and
displayed as client graphics. Depending on our responses to the program it will create the
graphics so that only the node is selectable (which is all that was supported before), so
that all of the primitives are selected, or so that only certain primitives are selectable
(every other face in this case).
Tapered Surface
Using Offset
Curve and
Ruled Surface
This sample demonstrates much of the wire body creation functionality. To run the
sample you must have a part open and select a planar face. This sample then creates a
trasient wire body using the geometry of the outside of the selected face. It then
transforms and offsets that wire, and finally creates a ruled surface between the original
wire and the offset wire. A base feature is created with the ruled surface.
Transient B-Rep
Ruled Surface
with Lines
Demonstrate creating a transient ruled surface. This sample uses all straight line segments
for each of the sections. A part document must be open.

Parameters
Name Type Description
AddInSiteObject ApplicationAddInSite
Input argument that specifies the object, which provides
access to the Autodesk Inventor Application object.
FirstTime Boolean
The FirstTime flag, if True, indicates to the Addin that
this is the first time it is being loaded and to take some
specific action. It does not take these actions when this
flag is False. Typically, when the flag is True, the AddIn
proceeds to create all of the objects under the
UserInterfaceManager that it needs - Environments,
Ribbons and Controls. These objects are persistent, but if
this is the first time the Addin is loaded, they need to be
created from scratch. When the FirstTime flag is False,
meaning the Addin has already been loaded, it only
needs to create the objects under the CommandManager -
CommandCategories and ControlDefinitions.

Parameters
Name Type Description
DocumentObject Document Input object that is being activated.
BeforeOrAfter EventTimingEnum
Input indicating if the event is being fired before (kBefore) or
after (kAfter) the document is activated. Notification is sent
before and after the document is activated.

the event fired. No context information is provided for this
event.
HandlingCode HandlingCodeEnum
Output that indicates how you are handling the event. The
value of this argument is currently ignored for this event.
Remarks
The OnActivateDocument event notifies a client when a document is activated. The definition of an
active document is the top-level document that is being displayed in the active window. The title of a
window also indicates the active document for that window. It's also important to understand that the
document currently being edited is not necessarily the active document. This happens in the case of inplace
editing in the context of an assembly. When you open an assembly document, the assembly is
the active document. If you in-place edit a part within the assembly, the assembly is still the active
document. The part being edited is the active edit object. The ApplicationEvents.OnNewEditObject
event provides notification when the active edit object changes and the Application.ActiveEditObject
property returns the current active edit object.

HandlingCodeEnum )
Parameters
ApplicationEvents Object Page 6 of 28
file:///C:/Users/Cliente/AppData/Local/Temp/~hh9748.htm 13/06/2025
Name Type Description
DocumentObject Document
The Document object that is being closed. The document
being closed is provided for both the kBefore and kAfter
cases. This is because the Document is still available after
it's closed, although in a limited sense, until it is terminated.
One of the useful things you can do with a document in this
state is to compare it's identity with a reference previously
saved (usually during kBefore). For example: Private
m_oClosingDoc As Object Private Sub
oAppEvents_OnClose(ByVal DocumentObject As
Document, ..., ByVal BeforeOrAfter As
EventTimingEnum, ...) If BeforeOrAfter = kBefore Then '
Check to see if the Document being closed is an interesting
one. If Interesting(DocumentObject) Then ' Save a
reference to the object. Set m_oClosingDoc =
DocumentObject End If Else ' Now we're either after the
close or it's been aborted. Check to see if the document is
the interesting one. If DocumentObject Is m_oClosingDoc
Then If BeforeOrAfter = kAfter then ' The document was
closed. ElseIf BeforeOrAfter = kAbort Then ' The close
was aborted. End If End If End Sub
FullDocumentName String
Output string that specifies the fully qualified name of the
document being closed. This is supplied both before and
after.
BeforeOrAfter EventTimingEnum
Input indicating if the event is being fired before (kBefore)
or after (kAfter) the document is closed. Notification is sent
before and after the document is closed. In the case where
this event is canceled the value of this argument will be
kAbort.
Context NameValueMap
Input object that can be used to determine the context of
why the event fired. This event provides additional
information through the Context argument as described
below: Name = "HealthStatusEnum", Value = The health
status of the document. If this value is anything other than
kUpToDateHealth you know the Document object returned
is not in a state where you can use most of its methods or
properties.
HandlingCode HandlingCodeEnum
This event supports the ability to cancel the close. By
setting this argument to kEventCanceled when the
BeforeOrAfter argument is kBefore Inventor will abort the
close. When the close is cancelled, this event is fired again
but the BeforeOrAfter argument will have a value of
kAbort.
Remarks
Note : The OnOpenDocument and OnCloseDocument events fire when the document is initially
opened and finally closed. This means if the file is referenced from an assembly, OnOpenDocument
will not fire if a loaded file referenced in an open assembly is opened again, as internally this file is
already open. Conversely, if a document is closed, the document is not really closed unless that was
the final view and the document is not referenced by any other open documents. To Veto the
OnCloseDocument event. When a document is about to be closed, the OnCloseDocument Application
event is fired with the BeforeOrAfter argument set to kBefore. If the event handler returns
ApplicationEvents Object Page 7 of 28
file:///C:/Users/Cliente/AppData/Local/Temp/~hh9748.htm 13/06/2025
HandlingCode argument set to kEventCancelled, the close operation is cancelled. Inventor then fires a
corresponding kAbort event. For example: Private Sub objAppEvents_OnCloseDocument(ByVal
DocumentObject As Document, ByVal FullFileName As String, ByVal BeforeOrAfter As
EventTimingEnum, ByVal Context As NameValueMap, HandlingCode As HandlingCodeEnum) If
BeforeOrAfter = kBefore Then Debug.Print "OnCloseDocument event vetoed" HandlingCode =
kEventCanceled End If End Sub

ApplicationEvents.OnDocumentChange Event
Parent Object: ApplicationEvents
Description
Fires just before the document is changed, supplying the reasons for change and the context in which
this action is being taken.
Syntax
ApplicationEvents.OnDocumentChange( DocumentObject As Document, BeforeOrAfter As
EventTimingEnum, ReasonsForChange As CommandTypesEnum, Context As NameValueMap,
HandlingCode As HandlingCodeEnum )
Parameters
Name Type Description
DocumentObject Document The Document object the change is occurring within.
BeforeOrAfter EventTimingEnum
Input EventTimingEnum indicating when the event is
being fired. This argument specifies if the notification is
being sent before a change is made (kBefore), after a
change is made (kAfter), or when a change has been
aborted (kAbort).
ReasonsForChange CommandTypesEnum
This argument indicates the type of change that occurred.
The value is from the CommandTypesEnum list, which
represents the different categories of changes that can be
made. Typically this will be a single value from the list but
it can represent multiple values that have been combined
together so you need to use bitwise operations to check for
a specific change.
Context NameValueMap Input NameValueMap object that can be used to determine
the context of why the event fired. This argument provides
additional information as described below:
Name = "DisplayName", Value = The display name of the
command that caused the change. This name will change
based on the language currently being used for Inventor.
ApplicationEvents Object Page 11 of 28
file:///C:/Users/Cliente/AppData/Local/Temp/~hh9748.htm 13/06/2025
Name = "InternalName", Value = The internal name of the
command that caused the change. This name will be
consistent regardless of the current language.
Name = "InternalNamesList", Value = as follows. When
the internal name is "CompositeChange" this value is
returned. Some commands result in making several
changes but combine or composite them into a single
command. The individual changes that were composited
into the single command are provided through this value.
It is an array of strings that consist of the internal names of
the individual changes made. For example, if you drag a
sketch point that connects two lines, the display name is
"Drag Sketch Inference", the internal name is
"CompositeChange" and the internal names list is an array
of the following three strings; "Modify Point", "Modify
Line", and "Modify Line".
Name = "ConsideredDirty", Value = "". If this name
appears in the context list then the change made is one that
causes the document to be dirty.
HandlingCode HandlingCodeEnum
Output that indicates how you are handling the event. This
event supports the ability to cancel the change. By setting
this argument to kEventCanceled when the BeforeOrAfter
argument is kBefore Inventor will abort the change. When
the change is cancelled, this event is fired again but the
BeforeOrAfter argument will have a value of kAbort.
Remarks
The OnDocumentChange event notifies a client when an action occurs that causes any change to a
document. The context information can be used to determine what the change is. The notification is
not sent for commands that do not change the document, i.e. measure and view commands. Care needs
to be taken when using this event because changes to the document are made so frequently that
depending on what you do in response to the event it can degrade the performance of Inventor. You
should perform simple checks first to see if the change is one that you're interested in before you
perform more expensive operations. Whenever possible you should use more specific events instead of
this general change event. For example, if you're interested in knowing when a parameter value
changes you can listen to the ModelingEvents.OnParameterChange event instead. This is both simpler
for you and more efficient, but not all actions that can occur within Inventor have corresponding
events so in many cases using the OnDocumentChange event is the only solution. When an object is
deleted from the document, it is possible to find out what that object is by querying
Document.SelectSet while in the kBefore state of this event.

ApplicationEvents.OnInitializeDocument Event
ApplicationEvents Object Page 12 of 28
file:///C:/Users/Cliente/AppData/Local/Temp/~hh9748.htm 13/06/2025
Parent Object: ApplicationEvents
Description
Event that is fired whenever a document is initialized. At the time this event fires, the document is not
open yet. Calling methods or properties on the document will force it to open.
Syntax
ApplicationEvents.OnInitializeDocument( DocumentObject As Document, FullDocumentName As
String, BeforeOrAfter As EventTimingEnum, Context As NameValueMap, HandlingCode As
HandlingCodeEnum )
Parameters
Name Type Description
DocumentObject Document The Document object that is being initialized.
FullDocumentName String
Output string that specifies the fully qualified name of the
document being initialized. This is supplied both before
and after.
BeforeOrAfter EventTimingEnum
Output EventTimingEnum indicating if the event is being
fired before (kBefore) or after (kAfter) the document is
initialized. Notification is sent before and after the
document is initialized.
Context NameValueMap
Output NameValueMap object that can be used to
determine the context of why the event fired. No context
information is provided for this event.
HandlingCode HandlingCodeEnum
Output HandlingCodeEnum that indicates how you are
handling the event. This argument is ignored for this event.
Remarks
The OnInitializeDocument event notifies a client when a document is being initialized. Initialization of
a document is essentially a low-level open. A portion of the document is opened to determine other
related files but the majority of the data is not opened and loaded. For example, when you open a
drawing, the referenced documents are initialized but are not fully loaded. If you perform an action
within the drawing that requires access to the data within any of the referenced documents then they
are automatically fully opened at that time. API calls on a document that is only initialized will also
cause the document to be fully opened. When a document is opened it is always initialized, but a
document can be initialized without being opened, if the additional data in the document is not needed.

ApplicationEvents.OnMigrateDocument Event
Parent Object: ApplicationEvents
ApplicationEvents Object Page 13 of 28
file:///C:/Users/Cliente/AppData/Local/Temp/~hh9748.htm 13/06/2025
Description
Event that is fired whenever a document is being explicitly migrated.
Syntax
ApplicationEvents.OnMigrateDocument( DocumentObject As Document, BeforeOrAfter As
EventTimingEnum, Context As NameValueMap, HandlingCode As HandlingCodeEnum )
Parameters
Name Type Description
DocumentObject Document Input Document object that is being migrated.
BeforeOrAfter EventTimingEnum
Input EventTimingEnum indicating if the event is being fired
before (kBefore) or after (kAfter) the document is migrated.
Context NameValueMap
Input NameValueMap object that can be used to determine the
context of why the event fired. No context information is
provided for this event.
HandlingCode HandlingCodeEnum
Output HandlingCodeEnum that indicates how you are
handling the event. This argument is ignored for this event.
Remarks
Explicit migration can occur in one of the following situations: * User selects the Migrate command
thru the user interface. * The Document.Migrate method is called via the API on a document needing
migration. * A document needing migration is saved. The event fires after Inventor has completed
migration of core data. This event provides an opportunity for client AddIns to migrate their data. The
OnMigrateDocument event notifies a client when a document is being fully migrated. Migration is the
process of updating the data within a document created in an older version of Inventor to the data
format of the current version. With delayed migration, documents created in Inventor version 11 and
newer are not fully migrated until a modified document is saved or the end-user executes the Migrate
command. This event is intended to be used by applications that are storing application specific data
within the Inventor document and may also need to migrate their data from one version to another.
They can use this event as one trigger to migrate. Other triggers, besides this event, may be when the
end-user attempts to modify their data or runs one of their commands that needs up to date data to
operate on.

Event that is fired whenever a new document is created.
Syntax
ApplicationEvents.OnNewDocument( DocumentObject As Document, BeforeOrAfter As
EventTimingEnum, Context As NameValueMap, HandlingCode As HandlingCodeEnum )
Parameters
Name Type Description
DocumentObject Document
Input object that was just created. When the BeforeOrAfter
argument is kBefore this argument will be Nothing because the
document does not yet exist.
BeforeOrAfter EventTimingEnum
Input indicating if the event is being fired before (kBefore) or
after (kAfter) the document is created. Notification is sent
before and after the document is created.
Context NameValueMap
Input object that can be used to determine the context of why
the event fired. This event provides additional information
through the Context argument as described below: Name =
"TemplateFilename", Value = The full filename of the file
used as the template when creating the new document. Name =
"NewFileName", Value = The full filename of the new file. In
most cases this value will be an empty string because the
filename of a new document is not specified until it is saved
for the first time. The exception to this is when the Create
Component command is used in an Assembly to create a new
part. In this case the filename is specified as part of the
command.

ApplicationEvents.OnNewEditObject Event
Parent Object: ApplicationEvents
Description
The OnNewEditObject event notifies a client when the edit object is changing.
Syntax
ApplicationEvents.OnNewEditObject( EditObject As Object, BeforeOrAfter As EventTimingEnum,
Context As NameValueMap, HandlingCode As HandlingCodeEnum )
Parameters
Name Type Description
EditObject Object
The new edit object. When the BeforeOrAfter argument is
kBefore this is the object that will become the edit object. When
the argument is kAfter this is the current edit object.
BeforeOrAfter EventTimingEnum
Input indicating if the event is being fired before (kBefore) or
after (kAfter) there is a new edit object. Notification is sent
before and after the edit object change is made.
Context NameValueMap
Input object that can be used to determine the context of why the
event fired. When an object is activated for edit within the
context of an assembly some additional information is provided
through the Context argument, as described below: Name =
"ActiveDocument", Value = The AssemblyDocument object that
the edit is within the context of. Name = "ActiveEditObject",
Value = The ComponentOccurrence object in the assembly the
edit is through.
HandlingCode HandlingCodeEnum
Output that indicates how you are handling the event. This
argument is ignored for this event.
Notes
A scenario that users need to be aware of is when you use this event to monitor opening a drawing
document, the active edit object(i.e. active sheet in the drawing in this case) will be available but its
parent drawing document still not becomes the active document, in this case users need to get the
parent drawing document from the Sheet.Parent.
Remarks
This event is useful in many cases but is particularly critical when adding additional tabs to the
browser. This event serves as the notification of when to add the browser tab. The OnOpenDocument
event is not satisfactory for this case because this event is fired for documents that are opened as a
result of being referenced in an assembly. In this context, most of the documents will not be directly
edited, so adding the browser information is a waste of resources. The OnActivateDocument event is
also unsatisfactory because when a document is edited in the context of an assembly, it is not
activated. The assembly remains the active document. What does change is the current edit object. The
ApplicationEvents Object Page 17 of 28
file:///C:/Users/Cliente/AppData/Local/Temp/~hh9748.htm 13/06/2025
edit object is the container object that is being edited by the end-user. For example when an assembly
document is opened, the assembly document is the active document and the active edit object. If the
end-user in-place activates a part in the assembly, the part becomes the active edit object, although the
assembly is still the active document because the edit is taking place in the context of the assembly. If
the end-user creates or edits a sketch within the part, the sketch becomes the active edit object. Valid
objects for edit objects are documents, 2d and 3d sketches, and drawing sheets.

argument is kBefore this argument will be Nothing because the
view does not yet exist.
BeforeOrAfter EventTimingEnum
Input EventTimingEnum indicating if the event is being fired
before (kBefore) or after (kAfter) the view is created.
Notification is sent before and after the view is created.
Context NameValueMap

Description
The OnOpenDocument event notifies a client when a document is opened.
Syntax
ApplicationEvents.OnOpenDocument( DocumentObject As Document, FullDocumentName As
String, BeforeOrAfter As EventTimingEnum, Context As NameValueMap, HandlingCode As
HandlingCodeEnum )
Parameters
Name Type Description
DocumentObject Document
The Document object being opened. When the
BeforeOrAfter argument is kBefore, this argument will be
nothing because the document does not yet exist.
FullDocumentName String
Output string that specifies the fully qualified name of the
document being opened. This is supplied both before and
after.
BeforeOrAfter EventTimingEnum
Output EventTimingEnum indicating if the event is being
fired before (kBefore) or after (kAfter) the document is
opened. Notification is sent before and after the document
is opened.
Context NameValueMap
Output NameValueMap object that can be used to
determine the context of why the event fired. Additional
information is provided through this argument to help in
understanding the context of how the document is being
opened. Name = "TopLevelFilename", Value = The full
filename of the top-level file that was opened that's causing
this file to be opened. For example, if an assembly is
opened and a document referenced by that assembly is
opened as a result, the TopLevelFilename will be the full
filename of the assembly. This value can be the same as the
FullDocumentName argument which indicates this
document was opened by itself.
HandlingCode HandlingCodeEnum
Output HandlingCodeEnum that indicates how you are
handling the event. The value of this argument is currently
ignored for this event.
Remarks
Documents are opened directly by the end-user using the Open command, but they are also opened
indirectly as a result of being referenced by another document. For example, if an assembly is opened
all of the documents referenced by the assembly are also opened. This notification is sent in all cases.
The Context argument provides information that can help determine the context of the open. You
should not assume that the events will always arrive in the same sequence. As an example, let us
say you are writing an Addin that listens to both the OnOpenDocument event and the
OnDocumentChange event. You are interested in a document called MyFavoriteDocument. Your
ApplicationEvents Object Page 19 of 28
file:///C:/Users/Cliente/AppData/Local/Temp/~hh9748.htm 13/06/2025
Addin assumes that the OnOpenDocument event will arrive before the OnDocumentChange event. In
its OnOpenDocument event handler it checks for MyFavoriteDocument and sets a global variable
MyFavoriteDocumentIsOpen as true. In the OnDocumentChange event handler, it first checks whether
MyFavoriteDocumentIsOpen is true, and only then takes any action. In your testing that code may
work, but fail on a customer's machine. This can happen when another Addin receives the
OnOpenDocument event before your Addin, and in its event handler makes a change to the document
- causing an OnDocumentChange event to be fired. So you will get OnDocumentChange event before
you get an OnOpenDocument event. So in this instance, the assumption that OnOpenDocument event
will always arrive before OnDocumentChange event on the same document, results in a very hard to
find problem. As a general rule, it's safer not to make any assumption about the order in which these
events will be received.

The OnReady event notifies a client when Inventor has completely initialized and is ready for
interactive use.
Syntax
ApplicationEvents.OnReady( BeforeOrAfter As EventTimingEnum, Context As NameValueMap,
HandlingCode As HandlingCodeEnum )
Parameters
Name Type Description
BeforeOrAfter EventTimingEnum
EventTimingEnum indicating if the event is being fired before
(kBefore) or after (kAfter) initialization is complete. This
notification is only provided after Inventor has initialized so the
value of this argument will always be kAfter.
Context NameValueMap
Input object that can be used to determine the context of why the
event fired. No context information is provided for this event.
HandlingCode HandlingCodeEnum
Output that indicates how you are handling the event. The value
of this argument is currently ignored for this event.
Remarks
This event fires (only once) after Inventor has completed its initialization. This includes initialization
of all the Add-ins loaded at startup. This event should be used in conjunction with the
Application.Ready property. This event is intended to be used by Add-Ins. When an Add-In is
activated by inventor, Inventor itself is still initializing at that point so there are a few limitations to
what an Add-In can do. An example is an Add-In that needs to access another Add-In or see what
other Add-Ins have been loaded. When the Add-In is activated, Inventor is in the process of activating
each Add-In and it's likely not all of the Add-Ins have been activated yet. By listening to the OnReady
event the Add-In can perform these types of tasks once Inventor is in completely loaded state.

file:///C:/Users/Cliente/AppData/Local/Temp/~hh9748.htm 13/06/2025
Name Type Description
DocumentObject Document Input object that is being saved.
BeforeOrAfter EventTimingEnum
Input indicating if the notification is being sent before the
document is saved (kBefore), after a change is made (kAfter),
or when a change has been aborted (kAbort).
Context NameValueMap
Input object that can be used to determine the context of why
the event fired. Additional information is provided through this
argument to help in understanding the context of the save.
Either SaveCopyAsFileName or SaveFileName is provided
depending on whether the end-user executed the Save or Save
Copy As command. The TopLevelSaveFileName is always
provided but in some cases will have an empty string as the
value. Name = SaveCopyAsFileName, Value = The full
filename of the new document being created. Name =
SaveFileName, Value = The full filename of the document
being saved. Name = TopLevelSaveFileName, Value =
Different values are returned depending on the context of the
save. When a document is saved in the context of another
document (for example, a part is saved when the assembly it is
in is saved) this will return the name of the top-level assembly.
When the notification is made for a save copy as operation this
value is the full filename of the original document that is being
saved to a new name. When the notification is made for a
standard save this value is the filename of the document being
saved. When a document is saved for the first time, this value
will be "" for the kBefore timing and the filename of the
document in the kAfter timing.
HandlingCode HandlingCodeEnum
Output that indicates how you are handling the event. This
event supports the ability to cancel the save. By setting this
argument to kEventCanceled when the BeforeOrAfter
argument is kBefore Inventor will abort the save. When the
save is cancelled, this event is fired again but the
BeforeOrAfter argument will have a value of kAbort.
Remarks
The notification is made when the standard Save and the Save Copy As commands are invoked. When
assemblies are saved this can also cause the dependent documents to be saved and this event is also
fired in those cases.

This sample demonstrates much of the wire body creation functionality. To run
the sample you must have a part open and select a planar face. This sample
then creates a trasient wire body using the geometry of the outside of the
selected face. It then transforms and offsets that wire, and finally creates a
ruled surface between the original wire and the offset wire. A base feature is
created with the ruled surface.

Samples
Name Description
Client
Graphics -
Line
This sample demonstrates the creation of custom graphics using LineGraphics and LineStripGraphics. The same set of
coordinate data is used for both types of graphics. Line graphics use two coordinates to define a line, and then the next two
coordinates to define the next line, and so on through the defined coordinates. For the data provided, this results in gaps in the
drawn curve. Line strips use the first two coordinates to define the first line and then the last point of the first line becomes the
first point of the second line and the next coordinate is used as the end point of the second line. This results in the set of points
being connected by a continuous set of lines, drawing a continuous curve. This sample also demonstrates two methods of
defining the color for client graphics. In one case it uses an existing appearance asset, and in the other, it explicitly defines a
color and assigns it. To use the sample you need to have an assembly or part document open. The program has two behaviors:
the first time it is run it will draw the graphics. The second time it is run it deletes the previously drawn graphics.

Parameters
Name Type Description
Point Point Input Point object that specifies the model space point at which to find the entities.
ObjectTypes SelectionFilterEnum
Input array of SelelctionFilterEnum values that indicate the type of objects to find. The values are the
enum values from the SelectionFilterEnum and can be combined to specify multiple object types.
ProximityTolerance Variant
Input Double that specifies the tolerance value for the search. This value defines the radius of a
sphere at the input point. All objects that intersect this sphere will be returned. If not specified, the
default internal tolerance is used.
This is an optional argument whose default value is null.
VisibleObjectsOnly Boolean

AssemblyComponentDefinition.FindUsingRay Method
Parent Object: AssemblyComponentDefinition
Description
Method that fires a ray through the part or assembly and returns the entities intersected by the ray. The objects intersected by the ray are
returned in the order in which they are intersected, with the first entities returned being those closest to the clipping plane.
Syntax
AssemblyComponentDefinition.FindUsingRay( RayStartPoint As Point, RayDirection As UnitVector, Radius As Double, FoundEntities As
ObjectsEnumerator, LocationPoints As ObjectsEnumerator, [FindFirstOnly] As Boolean )
Parameters
Name Type Description
RayStartPoint Point Input object that defines the start point of the ray in model space.
RayDirection UnitVector Input object that defines the direction of the ray. The ray is infinite in the direction defined.
Radius Double
Input Double that defines the radius of the ray. This value is specified in centimeters. Defining a radius for
a ray allows the intersection to be within a given tolerance. This radius essentially results in the definition
of a cylinder whose axis lies along the axis defined by the RayStartPoint and RayDirection. The
intersection result is between the cylinder and the model's entities. A value higher than zero is
recommended, though not explicitly required.
FoundEntities ObjectsEnumerator Output that returns the entities that were intersected by the ray.
LocationPoints ObjectsEnumerator
Output that returns a set of Point objects. One Point object is returned for each entity in the FoundEntities
list. The point defines the coordinate of the intersection between the ray and the corresponding entity.
FindFirstOnly Boolean
Optional input Boolean that specifies whether to find just the first entity in the ray's path. If False (the
default) then all entities found are returned.
This is an optional argument whose default value is False.
Remarks
There is a precedence in the type of entities returned. The entities returned can be Vertex, Edge, or Face objects. The precedence is in that order.
If the ray intersects a vertex, then that vertex is returned and none of the edges or faces that connect to that vertex are returned. If the ray
intersects an edge, then that edge is returned and none of the faces that connect to the edge are returned. If the ray intersects a face, then that
face is returned. If desired, you can use the functionality provided by the B-Rep portion of the API to obtain the various associated objects from
the entity returned. For example if you need a face but an edge is returned, you can use the Faces property of the Edge object to get the
associated faces. The start point defines the physical starting point from which to determine intersections. Any intersections behind the start
point are ignored. However, the ray is infinite from the start point, so all intersections in the direction of the ray will be returned. Note: As of
Autodesk Inventor 5.3 Service Pack 2, the FindUsingRay method has superseded LocateUsingRay.

of a cylinder if UseCylinder is True or the angle of the cone if False. If not specified, the default
internal tolerance is used.
This is an optional argument whose default value is null.
VisibleObjectsOnly Boolean
Optional input Boolean that indicates whether or not invisible objects should be included in the
search. Defaults to True indicating that invisible objects will be ignored.
This is an optional argument whose default value is True.

document.
SolutionType AngleConstraintSolutionTypeEnum
Optional input AngleConstraintSolutionTypeEnum that
specifies the solution type. If specified to be kDirectedSolution,
the solution always applies the right hand rule. If specified to be
kUndirectedSolution, the solution allows either orientation, thus
resolving situations where component orientation flips during a
constraint drive or drag. If specified to be
kReferenceVectorSolution, the ReferenceVectorEntity
argument must be provided with a third entity for the solution.

case when the first constraint on a part is a mate constraint. In
the case where the mate is between two planes, the parts can be
positioned anywhere along the infinite plane that defines their
mating contact. Using the bias points you can define the
position of the two occurrences, relative to each other. If a bias
point is not given, one is calculated that is at the center of the
parameter range of the input entity.

of the occurrence when it isn’t being controlled by another
constraint.
An example of when the bias points are useful is the case when
the first constraint on a part is a mate constraint. In the case
where the mate is between two planes, the parts can be
positioned anywhere along the infinite plane that defines their
mating contact. Using the bias points you can define the
position of the two occurrences, relative to each other.
If a bias point is not given, one is calculated that is at the center
of the parameter range of the input entity.
This is an optional argument whose default value is null.

Hence, the bias point must lie within the boundary of the input face. If a bias point is not given, one is calculated
that is at the center of the parameter range of the input entity. If this point is found not to lie within the face's
boundary, a random sample point within the boundary is used.

AssemblyDocument Object
Derived from: Document Object
Description
The AssemblyDocument object represents an in-memory Inventor assembly document.
Methods
Name Description
Activate Makes this document the active one (receives user-focus).
Close Closes this document.
CreateHighlightSet Method that creates a new highlight set.
FindWhereUsed Method that obtains the set of documents that reference the given file within this document.
GetLocationFoundIn Obtains the name of the location this file was found in.
GetMissingAddInBehavior Method that gets the commands disabled when a particular AddIn is absent.
GetPrivateStorage
Obtains a private sub-storage within this document with the given name. Can create one, if one does not
exist.
GetPrivateStream
Obtains a private stream within this document with the given name. Can create one, if one does not
exist.
GetSelectedObject
In order to provide better handling of system resources Inventor does not load all of the data when a
document is opened but delays loading information until it is needed. A common need in many
programs is to have the user select vertices on parts. Instead of loading the part model in order to return
the true selected Vertex, Inventor returns a GenericObject. You can use this method to obtain more
information about the selected object. If it is a vertex you can get the point coordinates without forcing
the entire model to be loaded, or if you do need to do additional processing that requires access to the
full model you can also force that by using the "SelectedObject" argument.
HasPrivateStorage Obtains a Boolean flag indicating if the specified sub-storage exists within this document.
HasPrivateStream Obtains a Boolean flag indicating if the specified stream exists within this document.
PutInternalNameAndRevisionId
Constructs and sets the Internal Name and Revision Identifier for this Document from strings supplied.
This can only be done on a previously un-saved document (New or SaveCopyAs)

the driving entities had been 'dirtied'.
ReleaseReference
Method that releases the reference that gets added if a document is opened invisibly through the API.
Releasing the reference on a hidden document makes it a candidate for closure the next time Inventor
closes all unreferenced documents.
RevertReservedForWriteByMe Method that reverts the file checked out by the caller.
Save Saves this document to disk.
Save2 Method that saves the document and the specified dependent documents.
SaveAs Saves this document into a file of the specified name.
SaveAs2 Saves this document into a file of the specified name.
SetMissingAddInBehavior Method that sets the commands to be disabled when a particular AddIn is absent.

AssemblyDocument.GetSelectedObject Method
Parent Object: AssemblyDocument
Description
In order to provide better handling of system resources Inventor does not load all of the data when a document is opened but delays
loading information until it is needed. A common need in many programs is to have the user select vertices on parts. Instead of loading
the part model in order to return the true selected Vertex, Inventor returns a GenericObject. You can use this method to obtain more
information about the selected object. If it is a vertex you can get the point coordinates without forcing the entire model to be loaded, or if
you do need to do additional processing that requires access to the full model you can also force that by using the "SelectedObject"
argument.
Syntax
AssemblyDocument.GetSelectedObject( Selection As GenericObject, ObjectType As ObjectTypeEnum, AdditionalData As
NameValueMap, ContainingOccurrence As ComponentOccurrence, [SelectedObject] As Variant )
Parameters
Name Type Description
Selection GenericObject Input object of type GenericObject that was obtained through a selection.
ObjectType ObjectTypeEnum Output ObjectTypeEnum value that indicates the type of object selected.
AdditionalData NameValueMap
Output NameValueMap object that provides any additional information for the
entity. The following describes the data currently returned.
Object Type Name Value
Vertex Point Point
ContainingOccurrence ComponentOccurrence Output ComponentOccurrence object that contains the entity that was selected.
SelectedObject Variant
Optional output that returns the actual entity that was selected. If this argument is
provided then Inventor will load whatever additional data is required from the referenced
document in order to provide the entity.
This is an optional argument whose default value is null.

Name Description
Client
Graphics -
Line
This sample demonstrates the creation of custom graphics using LineGraphics and LineStripGraphics. The same set of
coordinate data is used for both types of graphics. Line graphics use two coordinates to define a line, and then the next two
coordinates to define the next line, and so on through the defined coordinates. For the data provided, this results in gaps in the
drawn curve. Line strips use the first two coordinates to define the first line and then the last point of the first line becomes
the first point of the second line and the next coordinate is used as the end point of the second line. This results in the set of
points being connected by a continuous set of lines, drawing a continuous curve. This sample also demonstrates two methods
of defining the color for client graphics. In one case it uses an existing appearance asset, and in the other, it explicitly defines
a color and assigns it. To use the sample you need to have an assembly or part document open. The program has two
behaviors: the first time it is run it will draw the graphics. The second time it is run it deletes the previously drawn graphics.
Client
Graphics -
Triangle
This sample demonstrates the creation of client graphics triangles using triange fans and strips. It does this by drawing a
cylinder. The end caps are triangle fans and the cylinder is made from a triangle strip.

joint
This sample demonstrates creating an assembly joint. It connects the midpoints of the
edges of two faces using a rotational joint. To do this it first creates a geometry intent
object of the midpoint of the edge and then creates another intent using the face and
the midpoint intent. It does this to create to midpoint intents which it then uses to
create the rotational connection.
The sample uses and existing part that must be set up to allow it to work correctly. To
create the sample part you can use any part that has a planar face and a linear edge
connected to that planar face. A simple box is sufficient. In this part Add a mate
iMate to the planar face and rename the iMate to "Face1". Also add a mate iMate to a
linear edge that is on the face previously named and rename this iMate to
"Edge1". Save the part to "C:\Temp\SamplePart.ipt" or any other name and edit the
code below to reference the file. You can then run the sample code which will create
a new assembly, insert two instances of the part and create a rotational connection
between them. Then it will animation the rotation by driving the connection.

This sample demonstrates how to create a planar AssemblyJoint with offset to the OriginOne and OriginTwo.
Create rotational
assembly joint
This sample demonstrates creating an assembly joint. It connects the midpoints of the edges of two faces using a
rotational joint. To do this it first creates a geometry intent object of the midpoint of the edge and then creates another
intent using the face and the midpoint intent. It does this to create to midpoint intents which it then uses to create the
rotational connection.
The sample uses and existing part that must be set up to allow it to work correctly. To create the sample part you can
use any part that has a planar face and a linear edge connected to that planar face. A simple box is sufficient. In this
part Add a mate iMate to the planar face and rename the iMate to "Face1". Also add a mate iMate to a linear edge that
is on the face previously named and rename this iMate to "Edge1". Save the part to "C:\Temp\SamplePart.ipt" or any
other name and edit the code below to reference the file. You can then run the sample code which will create a new
assembly, insert two instances of the part and create a rotational connection between them. Then it will animation the

Parameters
Name Type Description
EntityOne Object
Input object that defines the first object. This object can be a planar face, work plane,
linear edge, work axis, or a face that defines an axis.
EntityTwo Object
Input object that defines the second object. This object can be a planar face, work
plane, linear edge, work axis, or a face that defines an axis.
Angle Variant
Input Variant that defines the angle between the two input entities. This can be either a
numeric value or a string. A parameter for this value is created and the supplied string
or value is assigned to the parameter. If a value is input, the units are radians. If a
string is input the units can be specified as part of the string or will default to the
current angle units of the document.
SolutionType AngleConstraintSolutionTypeEnum
Optional input AngleConstraintSolutionTypeEnum that specifies the solution type. If
specified to be kDirectedSolution, the solution always applies the right hand rule. If
specified to be kUndirectedSolution, the solution allows either orientation, thus
resolving situations where component orientation flips during a constraint drive or
drag. If specified to be kReferenceVectorSolution, the ReferenceVectorEntity
argument must be provided with a third entity for the solution. The default value is
kDirectedSolution.
This is an optional argument whose default value is 78593.
ReferenceVectorEntity Variant
Optional input object that provides a third entity to solve the angle constraint. This
argument is ignored if the SolutionType argument is not kReferenceVectorSolution.

when it isn't being controlled by another constraint. An example of when the bias
points are useful is the case when the first constraint on a part is a mate constraint. In
the case where the mate is between two planes, the parts can be positioned anywhere
along the infinite plane that defines their mating contact. Using the bias points you can
define the position of the two occurrences, relative to each other. If a bias point is not
given, one is calculated that is at the center of the parameter range of the input entity.
This is an optional argument whose default value is null.

Optional input Point object that is used help in determining the initial position of the
occurrence. The occurrences are repositioned in an attempt to make the two bias points
coincident. This provides some general control over the position of the occurrence
when it isn’t being controlled by another constraint.
An example of when the bias points are useful is the case when the first constraint on a
part is a mate constraint. In the case where the mate is between two planes, the parts
can be positioned anywhere along the infinite plane that defines their mating
contact. Using the bias points you can define the position of the two occurrences,
relative to each other.

Parameters
Name Type Description
EntityOne Object
Input object that defines the first object. This object can be a planar face, work plane, linear edge,
work axis, or a face that defines an axis.
EntityTwo Object
Input object that defines the second object. This object can be a planar face, work plane, linear
edge, work axis, or a face that defines an axis.
Angle Variant
Input Variant that defines the angle between the two input entities. This can be either a numeric
value or a string. A parameter for this value is created and the supplied string or value is assigned
to the parameter. If a value is input, the units are radians. If a string is input the units can be
specified as part of the string or will default to the current angle units of the document.
SolutionType AngleConstraintSolutionTypeEnum
Optional input AngleConstraintSolutionTypeEnum that specifies the solution type. If specified to
be kDirectedSolution, the solution always applies the right hand rule. If specified to be
kUndirectedSolution, the solution allows either orientation, thus resolving situations where
component orientation flips during a constraint drive or drag. If specified to be
kReferenceVectorSolution, the ReferenceVectorEntity argument must be provided with a third
entity for the solution. The default value is kDirectedSolution.
This is an optional argument whose default value is 78593.
ReferenceVectorEntity Variant
Optional input object that provides a third entity to solve the angle constraint. This argument is

another constraint. An example of when the bias points are useful is the case when the first
constraint on a part is a mate constraint. In the case where the mate is between two planes, the parts
can be positioned anywhere along the infinite plane that defines their mating contact. Using the
bias points you can define the position of the two occurrences, relative to each other. If a bias point
is not given, one is calculated that is at the center of the parameter range of the input entity.
This is an optional argument whose default value is null.

An example of when the bias points are useful is the case when the first constraint on a part is a mate constraint. In the case where
the mate is between two planes, the parts can be positioned anywhere along the infinite plane that defines their mating contact.
Using the bias points you can define the position of the two occurrences, relative to each other.
If a bias point is not given, one is calculated that is at the center of the parameter range of the input entity.
This is an optional argument whose default value is null.
BiasPointTwo Variant

Description
Dynamic attributes provide the ability for a programmer to add any arbitrary data to any persistent
object within Autodesk Inventor.
Methods
Name Description
FindAttributes Method that returns the Attribute objects that match the search criteria.
FindAttributeSets Method that returns attribute sets that have the specified names and values.
FindObjects Method that returns the objects that have the specified attributes.
FindObjectsByPattern
Method that returns the objects whose AttributeSets, if converted to XML,
satisfy the specified XSL pattern.
OpenAttributeSets
Finds the AttributeSet of the given name for each object in the object
collection. If it does not find one, it creates a new AttributeSet. returns the
in the same order as the object collection. Using this method is several
times faster than accessing AttributeSets for each object individually.
OpenAttributeSets works correctly even if the given collection has
degenerate objects such as an edge for the apex of a cone. In such a case,
OpenAttributeSets succeeds for all the valid objects, and returns NULL
objects for the degenerate objects.
PurgeAttributeSets
Method that finds and deletes the AttributeSets of the specified names
whose parent cannot be resolved. If preview flag is true, then instead of
deleting these AttributeSets, it returns their collection.

Description
Method that returns the Attribute objects that match the search criteria.
Syntax
AttributeManager.FindAttributes( [AttributeSetName] As String, [AttributeName] As String,
[AttributeValue] As Variant ) As AttributesEnumerator
Parameters
Name Type Description
AttributeSetName String
Optional input String value that specifies the name of the owning
attribute set. An asterisk can be used as a wild card in the string to
match partial strings. If this value is not input it will default to "*"
which will match all attribute sets. The search is not case sensitive.
This is an optional argument whose default value is ""*"".
AttributeName String
Optional input String value that specifies the name of the attribute,
including a compound name that contains nested sub-Attributes. An
asterisk can be used as a wild card in the string to match partial
strings. A dot is used as the delimiter between an attribute and its subattribute.
If this value is not input it will default to "*" which will
match all attributes. The search is not case sensitive. Thus,
"Color.Green*" will match an object that has an attribute whose name
is "color" with a sub-attribute, "green." The sub-attribute could also be
"greenish" as well and the match would succeed. But no match is
found if a 'color' object is found with no sub-attributes. On the other
hand, a query with simply "Color" will match all objects which may or
may not have sub-attributes, but do have the direct attribute, "color."
This is an optional argument whose default value is ""*"".
AttributeValue Variant Optional input Variant value that specifies the value of the attribute. In
the case of attributes that contain string values, an asterisk can be used
as a wild card in the string to match partial strings. For other types,
exact matches must be made. For some types, the value will be
ignored, i.e. arrays. If this argument is not specified it will ignore the
value and match based on the AttributeSetName and AttributeName
arguments.

AttributeSetName String
Optional input String value that specifies the name of the attribute set.
An asterisk can be used as a wild card in the string to match partial
strings. If this value is not input it will default to "*" which will match
all attribute sets. The search is not case sensitive.
This is an optional argument whose default value is ""*"".
AttributeName String
Optional input String value that specifies the name of any attribute
within the set, including a compound name that contains nested sub-
Attributes. An asterisk can be used as a wild card in the string to
match partial strings. A dot is used as the delimiter between an
attribute and its sub-attribute. If this value is not input it will default to

arguments.
This is an optional argument whose default value is null.
Remarks
About performance Using this method improves the performance of subsequent attributes
queries. Calling this method populates certain internal caches. Thus the time required to query
attributeSets properties on these objects is dramatically reduced. These caches remain valid till
you change or close the document(s). This affects only the objects owned by the document. To use
this method just for the purpose of populating the cache, you should call it without any arguments.
