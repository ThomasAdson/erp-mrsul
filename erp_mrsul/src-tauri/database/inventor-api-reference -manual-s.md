SectionDrawingView Object
Derived from: DrawingView Object
Description
The SectionDrawingView object represents a section view within a drawing. See the article in the overviews section.
Methods
Name Description
Align
Method that aligns this view with the input drawing view. The method returns a failure if
the view is already aligned. Use the Aligned property to check for this condition and to
break existing alignment.
AlignAuxiliary
Method that re-aligns an auxiliary view. The method fails if the view is not an auxiliary
view.
CopyTo
Method that copies this drawing view into the specified sheet. The new object is
returned.
CreateOriginIndicator
Method that creates the origin indicator for ordinate dimensions and hole tables. The
specified input GeometryIntent object must be associated with this drawing view,
otherwise this method will fail.
Delete Method that deletes the DrawingView.
DrawingViewToModelSpace
Method that takes a 2d coordinate in drawing view space, and returns a Line in model
space. Since this method transforms from 2D space to 3D space, there is insufficient
information to obtain a 3D model point. Hence, this method returns a Line in the view
direction on which the point lies. You may then use the FindUsingRay method to find
the point(s) of interest.
DrawingViewToSheetSpace
Method that takes a 2d coordinate in drawing view space, and returns a Point2d
containing the coordinates of the point in sheet space.
GetAutomatedCenterlineSettings
Method that returns the settings that define how automatic center lines and center marks
are to be calculated for this view.
GetHiddenLinesStatus Method that gets the hidden lines status of a component in the drawing view.
GetIncludeStatus Method that gets the include status of the input object in the drawing view.
GetReferenceKey Method that generates and returns the reference key for this entity.
GetVisibility Method that gets the visibility of the input object in the drawing view.
GetWeldmentState
Method that gets the weldment option for the drawing view. The method returns a failure
if the referenced model does not contain weldments.
InsertInModelSpace
Inserts the view geometry into model space only if the drawing lives in an Inventor
DWG file.
ModelToDrawingViewSpace
Method that takes a 3d coordinate in model space, and returns a Point2d object
containing the coordinate point in drawing view space.
ModelToSheetSpace
Method that takes a 3d coordinate in model space, and returns a Point2d object
containing the coordinate point in sheet space.
MoveTo
Method that moves this drawing view into the specified sheet. The moved object is
returned.
ReverseDirection Method that reverses the section line direction.
RotateByAngle Method that rotates the drawing view by the specified angle.
SetActiveModelState
Method that sets the active model state for a drawing view. In this method users can also
decide to update the PartsList objects which use the same model state as the drawing
view. This method fails for drawing views where the model is unresolved.
SetAutomatedCenterlineSettings
Method that sets the automatic centerline and center mark settings for this view and
creates the centerlines and center marks defined by the settings. The centerlines and
center marks that were created are returned.
SetDesignViewRepresentation
Method that sets a design view representation for a drawing view of an assembly. This
method fails for drawing views of parts and presentations and in the case where the
model (assembly) is unresolved.
SetHiddenLinesStatus Method that sets the hidden lines status of a component in the drawing view.

file:///C:/Users/Cliente/AppData/Local/Temp/~hhD195.htm 17/06/2025
SetIncludeStatus Method that sets the include status of the input object in the drawing view. This method
automatically makes the object visible as well. After an object has been included, its
visibility can be controlled using the GetVisibility and SetVisibility methods.
SetVisibility Method that sets the visibility of the input object in the drawing view.
SetWeldmentState
Method that sets the weldment option for the drawing view. The method returns a failure
if the referenced model does not contain weldments.
SheetToDrawingViewSpace
Method that takes a 2d coordinate in sheet space, and returns a Point2d object containing
the coordinate point in drawing view space.
SheetToModelSpace
Method that takes a 2d coordinate in sheet space, and returns a Line in model space.
Since this method transforms from 2D space to 3D space, there is insufficient
information to obtain a 3D model point. Hence, this method returns a Line in the view
direction on which the point lies. You may then use the FindUsingRay method to find
the point(s) of interest.
ShowHiddenAnnotations Method that displays all the annotations hidden by the user.
ShowHiddenCurves Method that displays all the curves explicitly hidden by the user.

Events
Name Description
OnPreSelect
Fires signaling that a particular object has been indicated as a potential
candidate for selection.
OnPreSelectMouseMove
Event that occurs while an object is in pre-select mode and the user is
moving the mouse. This allows you to receive mouse input relative to
the pre-selected object.
OnSelect Event that occurs when the user selects an entity.
OnStopPreSelect
Event that occurs when the currently pre-selected entity stops being
displayed in pre-selection highlight--happens usually when the user has
moved his/her mouse away from the vicinity of the pre-selected entity.
This way, the client programmer has the ability to display additional
graphics on pre-select and with the OnStopPreSelect knows when to
stop displaying this additional graphics. An example can be seen in the
Sketch trim command. As you move the mouse over some sketch
graphics, you see the preview of what the result will be if you select the
object and when you move away this trimmed preview is taken away.
OnUnSelect
Event that occurs when the user unselects an entity. This is done in the
user interface by pressing the Shift button and selecting a previously
selected entity.

Parameters
Name Type Description
PreSelectEntity Object
Input/Output. When called, Inventor returns the
entity the mouse is currently over. The client
though has a chance to change this entity to some
other, if so desired. The entity passed back from the
call is the one Inventor will highlight for the preselect.
DoHighlight Boolean
Input value that specifies whether the entity should
be available for selection or not. If True, this
signifies a successful pre-selection and the entity is
highlighted by Inventor.
MorePreSelectEntities ObjectCollection
Input argument through which you can supply a
group of objects that are logically pre-selected
along with the one that Inventor found on its own.
This argument is ignored if DoHighLight is False.
Inventor passes in an empty collection that you can
add additional entities to.
SelectionDevice SelectionDeviceEnum
Returns a constant denoting whether the selection
was made via a pick in a graphics window or was it
by a pick in the browser or by some other means.
An object can also be selected programmatically by
calling the selection simulation methods on the
CommandManager. A value of
kGraphicsWindowSelection indicates it was
selected in a graphic window. For all other values
the View, ModelPosition, and ViewPosition
arguments are meaningless.
ModelPosition Point
Returns the coordinates that result from projecting
the click point onto the selected entity. This is
returned in centimeters relative to model space.

Sketch Object Page 1 of 39
file:///C:/Users/Cliente/AppData/Local/Temp/~hhDFD5.htm 17/06/2025
Method that offsets a sketch entity or a group of connected
sketch entities. In both cases, the base sketch entity is first
offset by the specified distance and along the specified
direction. The base sketch entity is determined as follows: *
If only one sketch entity needs to be offset, it will be treated
as the base sketch entity. * If a group of end-to-end
connected entities need to be offset, the first entity in the
group will be treated as the base sketch entity. If this method
successfully offsets the specified input sketch entities, the
newly created sketch entities are returned.
OffsetSketchEntitiesUsingPoint
Method that offsets a sketch entity or a group of end-to-end
connected sketch entities. In both cases, the offset is first
applied to the base sketch entity such that the offset of the
base sketch entity passes through the specified offset point on
the sketch. The shortest distance of this offset point from the
original base sketch entity determines the offset distance.
RotateSketchObjects
Method that rotates a collection of sketch objects by a
specified angle. If the Copy argument is set to True, the
newly created objects are returned.
SetCustomLineType
Method that sets a custom line type to the curve from the

Sketch.OffsetSketchEntitiesUsingDistance
Method
Parent Object: Sketch
Description
Method that offsets a sketch entity or a group of connected sketch entities. In both cases, the base
sketch entity is first offset by the specified distance and along the specified direction. The base
sketch entity is determined as follows: * If only one sketch entity needs to be offset, it will be
treated as the base sketch entity. * If a group of end-to-end connected entities need to be offset, the
first entity in the group will be treated as the base sketch entity. If this method successfully offsets
the specified input sketch entities, the newly created sketch entities are returned.
Sketch Object Page 21 of 39
file:///C:/Users/Cliente/AppData/Local/Temp/~hhDFD5.htm 17/06/2025
Syntax
Sketch.OffsetSketchEntitiesUsingDistance( SketchEntities As ObjectCollection, OffsetDistance
As Double, NaturalOffsetDirection As Boolean, [IncludeConnectedEntities] As Boolean,
[CreateOffsetConstraints] As Boolean ) As SketchEntitiesEnumerator
Parameters
Name Type Description
SketchEntities ObjectCollection
ObjectCollection that specifies either a single sketch
entity or a set of sketch entities that need to be offset.
The collection can contain any SketchEntity object
except SketchPoint because sketch points cannot be
offset. The first entity in the collection is always
treated as the base sketch entity. The offset distance
(OffsetDistance argument) and the offset direction
(NaturalOffsetDirection argument) apply to this base
sketch entity. If only one sketch entity needs to be
offset, then it should be specified as the only item in
the collection and the IncludeConnectedEntities
argument should be specified as False. Since the
entity specified in the collection is the first and only
item in the collection, it will be treated as the base
sketch entity. If a group of end-to-end connected
sketch entities need to be offset, then they can be
specified using one of the following options: *
Specifying an exact set of sketch entities to offset.
The collection can be used to specify an exact set of
sketch entities that need to be offset. The objects in
the collection must represent entities that are end-toend
connected and the collection must contain the
objects in the order that they are connected. The first
entity specified in the collection will be treated as the
base sketch entity. * Specifying only the base sketch
entity and automatically including connected entities.
The base sketch entity should be specified as the only
item in the collection. The IncludeConnectedEntities
boolean argument should be specified as True to
indicate that all entities that form a loop (open or
closed) which contains the base sketch entity should
be automatically included to be offset. Since only one
of the above options to specify a group of connected
entities can be used at the same time and not both, if
the collection contains multiple entities, it implies
that the collection is being used to explicitly specify
an exact set of sketch entities to offset, in which case
the IncludeConnectedEntities argument should be
False. If True is specified, the method will fail and
the sketch entities will not be offset.
OffsetDistance Double Specifies the offset distance for the base sketch entity
(the sketch entity specified by the first item in the
Sketch Object Page 22 of 39
file:///C:/Users/Cliente/AppData/Local/Temp/~hhDFD5.htm 17/06/2025
SketchEntities collection). Since a group of
connected entities that need to be offset will all be
offset by the same distance, it implies that the
distance value specified by this argument will be
used not only for the base sketch entity but also for
all the remaining connected sketch entities. Since the
offset of the base sketch entity can lie on either side
of the base entity, the offset distance in itself does not
provide sufficient information regarding the final
position for the offset of the base sketch entity. The
NaturalOffsetDirection boolean argument can be
used to specify one out of the two possible offset
directions for the base sketch entity. Thus, the offset
distance specified by this argument and the offset
direction specified by the NaturalOffsetDirection
boolean argument together determine the final
position for the offset of the base sketch entity. Once
the offset position for the base sketch entity is
determined, the offset positions for any other
additional connected sketch entities can be inferred.
NaturalOffsetDirection Boolean
Value that can be used to specify one out of the two
possible offset directions. This argument applies to
the base sketch entity (the sketch entity specified by
the first item in the SketchEntities collection). The
natural offset direction is along the natural normal
direction at any point on the base sketch entity which
in-turn is defined as the cross-product of the vector
representing the tangent at that point and the vector
representing the sketch normal. If True is specified,
then the points on the offset of the base sketch entity
will be positioned in the direction specified by the
natural normal at the corresponding points on the
original base sketch entity. If False is specified, then
the offset of the base sketch entity will be positioned
in the direction opposite to that of the natural normal.
Thus, this argument determines on which side of the
base sketch entity the offset of the base sketch entity
will be placed. Since this argument specifies only the
offset direction, the OffsetDistance argument has to
be used to specify the offset distance along the offset
direction specified by this argument. Thus, the offset
direction specified by this argument and the offset
distance specified by the OffsetDistance argument
together determine the final position for the offset of
the base sketch entity. Once the offset position for
the base sketch entity is determined, the offset
positions for any other additional connected sketch
entities can be inferred.
IncludeConnectedEntities Boolean Value that specifies whether all entities that form a
loop containing the base sketch entity should also be
offset. If True is specified, then all loop entities will
be offset. But, if the sketch has multiple loops that
Sketch Object Page 23 of 39
file:///C:/Users/Cliente/AppData/Local/Temp/~hhDFD5.htm 17/06/2025
contain the base sketch entity in which case it will
not be possible to uniquely determine a single loop
that needs to be offset, only the base sketch entity
will be offset. If False is specified, then only the
entities specified in the SketchEntities collection will
be offset. If True is specified, the SketchEntities
collection should contain only one item that
corresponds to the base sketch entity, otherwise, if
the SketchEntities collection contains multiple
entities, then this method will fail and the sketch
entities will not be offset. If False is specified, the
SketchEntities collection can contain either a single
item that corresponds to the base sketch entity or
multiple items that correspond to a group of end-toend
connected entities. If the collection contains a
single item that corresponds to the base sketch entity,
then only this base sketch entity will be offset. On the
other hand, if the collection contains multiple items,
it implies that the collection is being used to specify
an exact set of sketch entities to offset, hence, only
those exact set of sketch entities will be offset. If no
value is specified for this argument, then a default
value of False will be assumed.
This is an optional argument whose default value is
False.
CreateOffsetConstraints Boolean
Value that specifies whether offset constraints
between the original and offset entities should be
automatically created. If True is specified, then offset
constraints will be automatically created. If False is
specified, then offset constraints will not be created.
If no value is specified, then a default value of True
will be assumed to indicate that the offset constraints
will be automatically created.
This is an optional argument whose default value is
True.
Remarks
In the case that a group of end-to-end connected entities need to be offset, the offset positions for
all other connected sketch entities can be inferred after the base sketch entity has been offset by
the specified distance and along the specified direction. (A group of connected entities that need to
be offset will all be offset by the same distance. Therefore, it implies that the specified offset
distance applies not only to the base sketch entity but also to all other remaining connected sketch
entities. The offset direction of the base sketch entity will be used to infer the offset directions for
the connected entities).

Sketch.OffsetSketchEntitiesUsingPoint
Method
Parent Object: Sketch
Description
Method that offsets a sketch entity or a group of end-to-end connected sketch entities. In both
cases, the offset is first applied to the base sketch entity such that the offset of the base sketch
entity passes through the specified offset point on the sketch. The shortest distance of this offset
point from the original base sketch entity determines the offset distance.
Syntax
Sketch.OffsetSketchEntitiesUsingPoint( SketchEntities As ObjectCollection, OffsetPoint As
Point2d, [IncludeConnectedEntities] As Boolean, [CreateOffsetConstraints] As Boolean ) As
SketchEntitiesEnumerator
Parameters
Name Type Description
SketchEntities ObjectCollection ObjectCollection that specifies either a single sketch
entity or a set of sketch entities that need to be offset.
The collection can contain any SketchEntity object
except SketchPoint because sketch points cannot be
offset. The first entity in the collection is always
treated as the base sketch entity. The offset distance
(OffsetDistance argument) and the offset direction
(NaturalOffsetDirection argument) apply to this base
sketch entity. If only one sketch entity needs to be
offset, then it should be specified as the only item in
the collection and the IncludeConnectedEntities
argument should be specified as False. Since the
entity specified in the collection is the first and only
item in the collection, it will be treated as the base
sketch entity. If a group of end\-to\-end connected
sketch entities need to be offset, then they can be
specified using one of the following options\: *
Specifying an exact set of sketch entities to offset.
Sketch Object Page 25 of 39
file:///C:/Users/Cliente/AppData/Local/Temp/~hhDFD5.htm 17/06/2025
The collection can be used to specify an exact set of
sketch entities that need to be offset. The objects in
the collection must represent entities that are end-toend
connected and the collection must contain the
objects in the order that they are connected. The first
entity specified in the collection will be treated as the
base sketch entity. * Specifying only the base sketch
entity and automatically including connected entities.
The base sketch entity should be specified as the only
item in the collection. The IncludeConnectedEntities
boolean argument should be specified as True to
indicate that all entities that form a loop (open or
closed) which contains the base sketch entity should
be automatically included to be offset.
Since only one of the above options to specify a
group of connected entities can be used at the same
time and not both, if the collection contains multiple
entities, it implies that the collection is being used to
explicitly specify an exact set of sketch entities to
offset, in which case the IncludeConnectedEntities
argument should be False. If True is specified, the
method will fail and the sketch entities will not be
offset.
OffsetPoint Point2d
Defines a point on the sketch through which the
offset of the base sketch entity (the sketch entity
specified by the first item in the SketchEntities
collection) should pass. The shortest distance of this
point from the base sketch entity is used to determine
the offset distance. This offset distance will also be
used to offset any other additional connected sketch
entities. The location of the point with respect to the
base sketch entity determines the position of the
offset base sketch entity (i.e. the location of the point
determines on which side of the base sketch entity
the offset of the base sketch entity will be
positioned). Once the offset distance and position for
the offset of the base sketch entity are determined,
this information is used to determine the position for
all other connected sketch entities that need to be
offset. Thus, the offset point provides sufficient
information to calculate the offset distance as well as
the offset direction for all the sketch entities that need
to be offset.
IncludeConnectedEntities Boolean Value that specifies whether all entities that form a
loop containing the base sketch entity should also be
offset. If True is specified, then all loop entities will
be offset. But, if the sketch has multiple loops that
contain the base sketch entity in which case it will
not be possible to uniquely determine a single loop
that needs to be offset, only the base sketch entity
Sketch Object Page 26 of 39
file:///C:/Users/Cliente/AppData/Local/Temp/~hhDFD5.htm 17/06/2025
will be offset. If False is specified, then only the
entities specified in the SketchEntities collection will
be offset. If True is specified, the SketchEntities
collection should contain only one item that
corresponds to the base sketch entity, otherwise, if
the SketchEntities collection contains multiple
entities, then this method will fail and the sketch
entities will not be offset. If False is specified, the
SketchEntities collection can contain either a single
item that corresponds to the base sketch entity or
multiple items that correspond to a group of
end\-to\-end connected entities. If the collection
contains a single item that corresponds to the base
sketch entity, then only this base sketch entity will be
offset. On the other hand, if the collection contains
multiple items, it implies that the collection is being
used to specify an exact set of sketch entities to
offset, hence, only those exact set of sketch entities
will be offset. If no value is specified for this
argument, then a default value of False will be
assumed.
This is an optional argument whose default value is
False.
CreateOffsetConstraints Boolean
Value that specifies whether offset constraints
between the original and offset entities should be
automatically created. If True is specified, then offset
constraints will be automatically created. If False is
specified, then offset constraints will not be created.
If no value is specified, then a default value of True
will be assumed to indicate that the offset constraints
will be automatically created.
This is an optional argument whose default value is
True.
Remarks
The base sketch entity is determined as follows: * If only one sketch entity needs to be offset, it
will be treated as the base sketch entity. * If a group of end-to-end connected entities need to be
offset, the first entity in the group will be treated as the base sketch entity. If this method
successfully offsets the specified input sketch entities, the newly created sketch entities are
returned. In the case that a group of end-to-end connected entities need to be offset, the offset
positions for all other connected sketch entities can be inferred after the base sketch entity has
been offset to pass through the specified point. (A group of connected entities that need to be
offset will all be offset by the same distance. Therefore, the offset distance between the original
base sketch entity and its offset will also be used to offset all other connected sketch entities. The
offset direction of the base sketch entity will be used to infer the offset directions for the
connected entities).

Delete
Method that deletes the 3D sketch. This method will fail in the cases where the
sketch is active, and when there are dependents on the sketch. In the cases
where other geometry, besides a feature, is dependent on the sketch, the
dependent geometry will be deleted or modified.
Edit
Method that causes the Sketch environment to be invoked with this sketch
available for interactive edit.
ExitEdit
Method that causes the Sketch environment to be closed and the user interface
to return to the previous environment. This is equivalent to the Return
command. This method is only valid in the case where this sketch is open for
edit within the user interface. Calling this method in other cases will not do
anything.
GetReferenceKey Method that generates and returns the reference key for this entity.
Include
Method that creates a new sketch entity by copying other entities into the
sketch.
SetEndOfPart
Method that repositions the end-of-part marker relative to the object this
method is called from. The argument defines if the end-of-part marker will be
positioned just before or just after the object. If the object is contained within
another object and is not in the top level of the browser, the positioning of the
marker will be relative to the top-level object the calling object is contained
within. An example of this case is a sketch that has not been shared and has
been consumed by a feature. Another example is a nested work feature.
Solve Method that causes the sketch to solve.

Name Description
Control point,
equation, and
intersection curve
creation.
This sample demonstrates several new curve creation techniques introduced
in Inventor 2014. It creates a new part and then create a 2d control point
spline and a 2d equation curve. Surfaces are created from these two curves
by extruding them. A 3d intersection curve is created between the extrusions.
A 3d control point spline and 3d equation curve are also created.
Loft Feature With
Non-Planar Section
This sample demonstrates the creation of a loft feature. It uses two sections
for the loft, one is from a 2d sketch and the other is a non-planar section from
a 3d sketch. Because one of the sketches isn't planar, a surface is created
instead of a solid.
Sweep Feature
Add
This sample demonstrates the creation of a sweep feature. The profile is a
circle, but the path is made up of a 3D sketch and a 2D sketch.

Method that creates a straight slot. The sketch entities represent the sketch slot are
returned.
AdjustContext
Method that returns the specified sketch object scoped into this sketch block definition,
trimming any portion of the context from any sketch block in which this definition has
been instanced. In other words, for the given object, this method returns the
corresponding object in the context of this sketch block definition, by trimming the
sketch block path.
BreakLink Method that breaks the link to the source sketch.
CopyContentsTo Method that copies all the contents of the sketch to the \input target sketch.
CopyEntitiesTo Method that copies sketch entities of the sketch to the input target sketch.
CopyTo Method that copies the definition to the target document.
Delete
Method that deletes the sketch. This method is only valid for sketches that are not used
by a feature.
Edit
Method that causes the Sketch environment to be invoked with this sketch available
for interactive edit.
ExitEdit
Causes the Sketch environment to be closed and the user interface to return to the
previous environment. This is equivalent to the Return command. This method is only
valid in the case where this sketch is open for edit within the user interface.
GetCustomLineType
Method that returns information regarding the custom line type in use. The method
returns a failure if the return value of the LineType property is not kCustomLineType.
GetReferenceKey Method that generates and returns the reference key for this entity.
ModelToSketchSpace
Method that takes a 3D coordinate in model space, projects it onto the sketch plane
along the normal of the plane and returns a Point2d object containing the resulting
coordinate point in sketch space.
MoveSketchObjects
Method that moves a collection of sketch objects by a specified vector. If the Copy
argument is set to True, the newly created objects are returned.
OffsetSketchEntitiesUsingDistance
Method that offsets a sketch entity or a group of connected sketch entities. In both
cases, the base sketch entity is first offset by the specified distance and along the
specified direction. The base sketch entity is determined as follows: * If only one
sketch entity needs to be offset, it will be treated as the base sketch entity. * If a group
of end-to-end connected entities need to be offset, the first entity in the group will be
treated as the base sketch entity. If this method successfully offsets the specified input
sketch entities, the newly created sketch entities are returned.
OffsetSketchEntitiesUsingPoint
SketchBlockDefinition Object Page 1 of 42
file:///C:/Users/Cliente/AppData/Local/Temp/~hh6FEB.htm 17/06/2025
Method that offsets a sketch entity or a group of end-to-end connected sketch entities.
In both cases, the offset is first applied to the base sketch entity such that the offset of
the base sketch entity passes through the specified offset point on the sketch. The
shortest distance of this offset point from the original base sketch entity determines the
offset distance.
RotateSketchObjects
Method that rotates a collection of sketch objects by a specified angle. If the Copy
argument is set to True, the newly created objects are returned.
SetCustomLineType
Method that sets a custom line type to the curve from the specified .lin file. The
method automatically changes the value of LineType property to kCustomLineType.
SetEndOfPart
Method that repositions the end-of-part marker relative to the object this method is
called from. The argument defines if the end-of-part marker will be positioned just
before or just after the object. If the object is contained within another object and is not
in the top level of the browser, the positioning of the marker will be relative to the toplevel
object the calling object is contained within. An example of this case is a sketch
that has not been shared and has been consumed by a feature. Another example is a
nested work feature.
SketchToModelSpace
Method that takes a 2D coordinate in sketch space, and returns a Point3d containing
the coordinates of the point in model space.
Solve Method that causes the sketch to solve.
UpdateProfiles Method that updates all the profiles within the sketch.

Method
Parent Object: SketchBlockDefinition
SketchBlockDefinition Object Page 24 of 42
file:///C:/Users/Cliente/AppData/Local/Temp/~hh6FEB.htm 17/06/2025
Description
Method that offsets a sketch entity or a group of connected sketch entities. In both cases, the base sketch entity is first offset
by the specified distance and along the specified direction. The base sketch entity is determined as follows: * If only one
sketch entity needs to be offset, it will be treated as the base sketch entity. * If a group of end-to-end connected entities
need to be offset, the first entity in the group will be treated as the base sketch entity. If this method successfully offsets the
specified input sketch entities, the newly created sketch entities are returned.
Syntax
SketchBlockDefinition.OffsetSketchEntitiesUsingDistance( SketchEntities As ObjectCollection, OffsetDistance As
Double, NaturalOffsetDirection As Boolean, [IncludeConnectedEntities] As Boolean, [CreateOffsetConstraints] As
Boolean ) As SketchEntitiesEnumerator
Parameters
Name Type Description
SketchEntities ObjectCollection
ObjectCollection that specifies either a single sketch entity or a set of sketch
entities that need to be offset. The collection can contain any SketchEntity
object except SketchPoint because sketch points cannot be offset. The first
entity in the collection is always treated as the base sketch entity. The offset
distance (OffsetDistance argument) and the offset direction
(NaturalOffsetDirection argument) apply to this base sketch entity. If only one
sketch entity needs to be offset, then it should be specified as the only item in
the collection and the IncludeConnectedEntities argument should be specified
as False. Since the entity specified in the collection is the first and only item in
the collection, it will be treated as the base sketch entity. If a group of end-toend
connected sketch entities need to be offset, then they can be specified
using one of the following options: * Specifying an exact set of sketch entities
to offset. The collection can be used to specify an exact set of sketch entities
that need to be offset. The objects in the collection must represent entities that
are end-to-end connected and the collection must contain the objects in the
order that they are connected. The first entity specified in the collection will be
treated as the base sketch entity. * Specifying only the base sketch entity and
automatically including connected entities. The base sketch entity should be
specified as the only item in the collection. The IncludeConnectedEntities
boolean argument should be specified as True to indicate that all entities that
form a loop (open or closed) which contains the base sketch entity should be
automatically included to be offset. Since only one of the above options to
specify a group of connected entities can be used at the same time and not
both, if the collection contains multiple entities, it implies that the collection is
being used to explicitly specify an exact set of sketch entities to offset, in
which case the IncludeConnectedEntities argument should be False. If True is
specified, the method will fail and the sketch entities will not be offset.
OffsetDistance Double
Specifies the offset distance for the base sketch entity (the sketch entity
specified by the first item in the SketchEntities collection). Since a group of
connected entities that need to be offset will all be offset by the same distance,
it implies that the distance value specified by this argument will be used not
only for the base sketch entity but also for all the remaining connected sketch
entities. Since the offset of the base sketch entity can lie on either side of the
base entity, the offset distance in itself does not provide sufficient information
regarding the final position for the offset of the base sketch entity. The
NaturalOffsetDirection boolean argument can be used to specify one out of the
two possible offset directions for the base sketch entity. Thus, the offset
distance specified by this argument and the offset direction specified by the
NaturalOffsetDirection boolean argument together determine the final position
for the offset of the base sketch entity. Once the offset position for the base
sketch entity is determined, the offset positions for any other additional
connected sketch entities can be inferred.
NaturalOffsetDirection Boolean Value that can be used to specify one out of the two possible offset directions.
This argument applies to the base sketch entity (the sketch entity specified by
the first item in the SketchEntities collection). The natural offset direction is
along the natural normal direction at any point on the base sketch entity which
SketchBlockDefinition Object Page 25 of 42
file:///C:/Users/Cliente/AppData/Local/Temp/~hh6FEB.htm 17/06/2025
in-turn is defined as the cross-product of the vector representing the tangent at
that point and the vector representing the sketch normal. If True is specified,
then the points on the offset of the base sketch entity will be positioned in the
direction specified by the natural normal at the corresponding points on the
original base sketch entity. If False is specified, then the offset of the base
sketch entity will be positioned in the direction opposite to that of the natural
normal. Thus, this argument determines on which side of the base sketch entity
the offset of the base sketch entity will be placed. Since this argument
specifies only the offset direction, the OffsetDistance argument has to be used
to specify the offset distance along the offset direction specified by this
argument. Thus, the offset direction specified by this argument and the offset
distance specified by the OffsetDistance argument together determine the final
position for the offset of the base sketch entity. Once the offset position for the
base sketch entity is determined, the offset positions for any other additional
connected sketch entities can be inferred.
IncludeConnectedEntities Boolean
Value that specifies whether all entities that form a loop containing the base
sketch entity should also be offset. If True is specified, then all loop entities
will be offset. But, if the sketch has multiple loops that contain the base sketch
entity in which case it will not be possible to uniquely determine a single loop
that needs to be offset, only the base sketch entity will be offset. If False is
specified, then only the entities specified in the SketchEntities collection will
be offset. If True is specified, the SketchEntities collection should contain only
one item that corresponds to the base sketch entity, otherwise, if the
SketchEntities collection contains multiple entities, then this method will fail
and the sketch entities will not be offset. If False is specified, the
SketchEntities collection can contain either a single item that corresponds to
the base sketch entity or multiple items that correspond to a group of end-toend
connected entities. If the collection contains a single item that corresponds
to the base sketch entity, then only this base sketch entity will be offset. On the
other hand, if the collection contains multiple items, it implies that the
collection is being used to specify an exact set of sketch entities to offset,
hence, only those exact set of sketch entities will be offset. If no value is
specified for this argument, then a default value of False will be assumed.
This is an optional argument whose default value is False.
CreateOffsetConstraints Boolean
Value that specifies whether offset constraints between the original and offset
entities should be automatically created. If True is specified, then offset
constraints will be automatically created. If False is specified, then offset
constraints will not be created. If no value is specified, then a default value of
True will be assumed to indicate that the offset constraints will be
automatically created.
This is an optional argument whose default value is True.

Method
Parent Object: SketchBlockDefinition
Description
Method that offsets a sketch entity or a group of end-to-end connected sketch entities. In both cases, the offset is first
applied to the base sketch entity such that the offset of the base sketch entity passes through the specified offset point on the
sketch. The shortest distance of this offset point from the original base sketch entity determines the offset distance.

SketchEntities ObjectCollection
ObjectCollection that specifies either a single sketch entity or a set of sketch
entities that need to be offset. The collection can contain any SketchEntity

distance (OffsetDistance argument) and the offset direction
(NaturalOffsetDirection argument) apply to this base sketch entity. If only one
sketch entity needs to be offset, then it should be specified as the only item in
the collection and the IncludeConnectedEntities argument should be specified
as False. Since the entity specified in the collection is the first and only item in
the collection, it will be treated as the base sketch entity. If a group of
end\-to\-end connected sketch entities need to be offset, then they can be
specified using one of the following options\: * Specifying an exact set of
sketch entities to offset. The collection can be used to specify an exact set of
sketch entities that need to be offset. The objects in the collection must
represent entities that are end-to-end connected and the collection must contain
the objects in the order that they are connected. The first entity specified in the
collection will be treated as the base sketch entity. * Specifying only the base
sketch entity and automatically including connected entities. The base sketch
entity should be specified as the only item in the collection. The
IncludeConnectedEntities boolean argument should be specified as True to
indicate that all entities that form a loop (open or closed) which contains the
base sketch entity should be automatically included to be offset.
Since only one of the above options to specify a group of connected entities
can be used at the same time and not both, if the collection contains multiple
entities, it implies that the collection is being used to explicitly specify an
exact set of sketch entities to offset, in which case the
IncludeConnectedEntities argument should be False. If True is specified, the
method will fail and the sketch entities will not be offset.
OffsetPoint Point2d
Defines a point on the sketch through which the offset of the base sketch entity
(the sketch entity specified by the first item in the SketchEntities collection)
should pass. The shortest distance of this point from the base sketch entity is
used to determine the offset distance. This offset distance will also be used to
offset any other additional connected sketch entities. The location of the point
with respect to the base sketch entity determines the position of the offset base
sketch entity (i.e. the location of the point determines on which side of the
base sketch entity the offset of the base sketch entity will be positioned). Once
the offset distance and position for the offset of the base sketch entity are
determined, this information is used to determine the position for all other
connected sketch entities that need to be offset. Thus, the offset point provides
sufficient information to calculate the offset distance as well as the offset
direction for all the sketch entities that need to be offset.
IncludeConnectedEntities Boolean Value that specifies whether all entities that form a loop containing the base
sketch entity should also be offset. If True is specified, then all loop entities
will be offset. But, if the sketch has multiple loops that contain the base sketch
entity in which case it will not be possible to uniquely determine a single loop
that needs to be offset, only the base sketch entity will be offset. If False is
specified, then only the entities specified in the SketchEntities collection will
be offset. If True is specified, the SketchEntities collection should contain only
one item that corresponds to the base sketch entity, otherwise, if the
SketchEntities collection contains multiple entities, then this method will fail
and the sketch entities will not be offset. If False is specified, the
SketchEntities collection can contain either a single item that corresponds to
the base sketch entity or multiple items that correspond to a group of
SketchBlockDefinition Object Page 27 of 42
file:///C:/Users/Cliente/AppData/Local/Temp/~hh6FEB.htm 17/06/2025
end\-to\-end connected entities. If the collection contains a single item that
corresponds to the base sketch entity, then only this base sketch entity will be
offset. On the other hand, if the collection contains multiple items, it implies
that the collection is being used to specify an exact set of sketch entities to
offset, hence, only those exact set of sketch entities will be offset. If no value
is specified for this argument, then a default value of False will be assumed.
This is an optional argument whose default value is False.
CreateOffsetConstraints Boolean
Value that specifies whether offset constraints between the original and offset
entities should be automatically created. If True is specified, then offset
constraints will be automatically created. If False is specified, then offset
constraints will not be created. If no value is specified, then a default value of
True will be assumed to indicate that the offset constraints will be
automatically created.
This is an optional argument whose default value is True.

Method that returns the specified sketch object scoped into this sketch block definition, trimming
any portion of the context from any sketch block in which this definition has been instanced. In other
words, for the given object, this method returns the corresponding object in the context of this sketch
block definition, by trimming the sketch block path.
BreakLink Method that breaks the link to the source sketch.
CopyContentsTo Method that copies all the contents of the sketch to the \input target sketch.
CopyEntitiesTo Method that copies sketch entities of the sketch to the input target sketch.

Edit
Method that causes the Sketch environment to be invoked with this sketch available for interactive
edit.
ExitEdit
Causes the Sketch environment to be closed and the user interface to return to the previous
environment. This is equivalent to the Return command. This method is only valid in the case where
this sketch is open for edit within the user interface.
GetCustomLineType
Method that returns information regarding the custom line type in use. The method returns a failure
if the return value of the LineType property is not kCustomLineType.
GetReferenceKey Method that generates and returns the reference key for this entity.

Method that takes a 3D coordinate in model space, projects it onto the sketch plane along the normal
of the plane and returns a Point2d object containing the resulting coordinate point in sketch space.
MoveSketchObjects
Method that moves a collection of sketch objects by a specified vector. If the Copy argument is set to
True, the newly created objects are returned.
OffsetSketchEntitiesUsingDistance
Method that offsets a sketch entity or a group of connected sketch entities. In both cases, the base
sketch entity is first offset by the specified distance and along the specified direction. The base
sketch entity is determined as follows: * If only one sketch entity needs to be offset, it will be treated
as the base sketch entity. * If a group of end-to-end connected entities need to be offset, the first
entity in the group will be treated as the base sketch entity. If this method successfully offsets the
specified input sketch entities, the newly created sketch entities are returned.
OffsetSketchEntitiesUsingPoint
Method that offsets a sketch entity or a group of end-to-end connected sketch entities. In both cases,
the offset is first applied to the base sketch entity such that the offset of the base sketch entity passes
through the specified offset point on the sketch. The shortest distance of this offset point from the
original base sketch entity determines the offset distance.
RotateSketchObjects
Method that rotates a collection of sketch objects by a specified angle. If the Copy argument is set to
True, the newly created objects are returned.
SetCustomLineType
Method that sets a custom line type to the curve from the specified .lin file. The method
automatically changes the value of LineType property to kCustomLineType.
SetEndOfPart
Method that repositions the end-of-part marker relative to the object this method is called from. The
argument defines if the end-of-part marker will be positioned just before or just after the object. If
the object is contained within another object and is not in the top level of the browser, the
positioning of the marker will be relative to the top-level object the calling object is contained
within. An example of this case is a sketch that has not been shared and has been consumed by a
feature. Another example is a nested work feature.
SketchToModelSpace
Method that takes a 2D coordinate in sketch space, and returns a Point3d containing the coordinates
of the point in model space.

group will be treated as the base sketch entity. If this method successfully offsets the specified input sketch entities, the newly created
sketch entities are returned.

Syntax
SketchBlockDefinitionProxy.OffsetSketchEntitiesUsingDistance( SketchEntities As ObjectCollection, OffsetDistance As Double,
NaturalOffsetDirection As Boolean, [IncludeConnectedEntities] As Boolean, [CreateOffsetConstraints] As Boolean ) As
SketchEntitiesEnumerator
Parameters
Name Type Description
SketchEntities ObjectCollection
ObjectCollection that specifies either a single sketch entity or a set of sketch entities that
need to be offset. The collection can contain any SketchEntity object except SketchPoint
because sketch points cannot be offset. The first entity in the collection is always treated as
the base sketch entity. The offset distance (OffsetDistance argument) and the offset direction
(NaturalOffsetDirection argument) apply to this base sketch entity. If only one sketch entity
needs to be offset, then it should be specified as the only item in the collection and the
IncludeConnectedEntities argument should be specified as False. Since the entity specified
in the collection is the first and only item in the collection, it will be treated as the base
sketch entity. If a group of end-to-end connected sketch entities need to be offset, then they
can be specified using one of the following options: * Specifying an exact set of sketch
entities to offset. The collection can be used to specify an exact set of sketch entities that
need to be offset. The objects in the collection must represent entities that are end-to-end
connected and the collection must contain the objects in the order that they are connected.
The first entity specified in the collection will be treated as the base sketch entity. *
Specifying only the base sketch entity and automatically including connected entities. The
base sketch entity should be specified as the only item in the collection. The
IncludeConnectedEntities boolean argument should be specified as True to indicate that all
entities that form a loop (open or closed) which contains the base sketch entity should be
automatically included to be offset. Since only one of the above options to specify a group of
connected entities can be used at the same time and not both, if the collection contains
multiple entities, it implies that the collection is being used to explicitly specify an exact set
of sketch entities to offset, in which case the IncludeConnectedEntities argument should be
False. If True is specified, the method will fail and the sketch entities will not be offset.
OffsetDistance Double
Specifies the offset distance for the base sketch entity (the sketch entity specified by the first
item in the SketchEntities collection). Since a group of connected entities that need to be
offset will all be offset by the same distance, it implies that the distance value specified by
this argument will be used not only for the base sketch entity but also for all the remaining
connected sketch entities. Since the offset of the base sketch entity can lie on either side of
the base entity, the offset distance in itself does not provide sufficient information regarding
the final position for the offset of the base sketch entity. The NaturalOffsetDirection boolean
argument can be used to specify one out of the two possible offset directions for the base
sketch entity. Thus, the offset distance specified by this argument and the offset direction
specified by the NaturalOffsetDirection boolean argument together determine the final
position for the offset of the base sketch entity. Once the offset position for the base sketch
entity is determined, the offset positions for any other additional connected sketch entities
can be inferred.
NaturalOffsetDirection Boolean
Value that can be used to specify one out of the two possible offset directions. This argument
applies to the base sketch entity (the sketch entity specified by the first item in the
SketchEntities collection). The natural offset direction is along the natural normal direction
at any point on the base sketch entity which in-turn is defined as the cross-product of the
vector representing the tangent at that point and the vector representing the sketch normal. If
True is specified, then the points on the offset of the base sketch entity will be positioned in
the direction specified by the natural normal at the corresponding points on the original base
sketch entity. If False is specified, then the offset of the base sketch entity will be positioned
in the direction opposite to that of the natural normal. Thus, this argument determines on
which side of the base sketch entity the offset of the base sketch entity will be placed. Since
this argument specifies only the offset direction, the OffsetDistance argument has to be used
to specify the offset distance along the offset direction specified by this argument. Thus, the
offset direction specified by this argument and the offset distance specified by the
OffsetDistance argument together determine the final position for the offset of the base
sketch entity. Once the offset position for the base sketch entity is determined, the offset
positions for any other additional connected sketch entities can be inferred.
IncludeConnectedEntities Boolean Value that specifies whether all entities that form a loop containing the base sketch entity
should also be offset. If True is specified, then all loop entities will be offset. But, if the
sketch has multiple loops that contain the base sketch entity in which case it will not be
possible to uniquely determine a single loop that needs to be offset, only the base sketch
entity will be offset. If False is specified, then only the entities specified in the
SketchEntities collection will be offset. If True is specified, the SketchEntities collection
should contain only one item that corresponds to the base sketch entity, otherwise, if the
SketchEntities collection contains multiple entities, then this method will fail and the sketch
entities will not be offset. If False is specified, the SketchEntities collection can contain
either a single item that corresponds to the base sketch entity or multiple items that

file:///C:/Users/Cliente/AppData/Local/Temp/~hhB011.htm 17/06/2025
correspond to a group of end-to-end connected entities. If the collection contains a single
item that corresponds to the base sketch entity, then only this base sketch entity will be
offset. On the other hand, if the collection contains multiple items, it implies that the
collection is being used to specify an exact set of sketch entities to offset, hence, only those
exact set of sketch entities will be offset. If no value is specified for this argument, then a
default value of False will be assumed.
This is an optional argument whose default value is False.
CreateOffsetConstraints Boolean
Value that specifies whether offset constraints between the original and offset entities should

SketchBlockDefinitionProxy.OffsetSketchEntitiesUsingPoint
Method
Parent Object: SketchBlockDefinitionProxy
Description
Method that offsets a sketch entity or a group of end-to-end connected sketch entities. In both cases, the offset is first applied to the base
sketch entity such that the offset of the base sketch entity passes through the specified offset point on the sketch. The shortest distance of
this offset point from the original base sketch entity determines the offset distance.
Syntax
SketchBlockDefinitionProxy.OffsetSketchEntitiesUsingPoint( SketchEntities As ObjectCollection, OffsetPoint As Point2d,
[IncludeConnectedEntities] As Boolean, [CreateOffsetConstraints] As Boolean ) As SketchEntitiesEnumerator
Parameters
Name Type Description
SketchEntities ObjectCollection
ObjectCollection that specifies either a single sketch entity or a set of sketch entities that
need to be offset. The collection can contain any SketchEntity object except SketchPoint
because sketch points cannot be offset. The first entity in the collection is always treated as
the base sketch entity. The offset distance (OffsetDistance argument) and the offset direction
(NaturalOffsetDirection argument) apply to this base sketch entity. If only one sketch entity
needs to be offset, then it should be specified as the only item in the collection and the
IncludeConnectedEntities argument should be specified as False. Since the entity specified
in the collection is the first and only item in the collection, it will be treated as the base
sketch entity. If a group of end\-to\-end connected sketch entities need to be offset, then they
can be specified using one of the following options\: * Specifying an exact set of sketch
entities to offset. The collection can be used to specify an exact set of sketch entities that
need to be offset. The objects in the collection must represent entities that are end-to-end
connected and the collection must contain the objects in the order that they are connected.
The first entity specified in the collection will be treated as the base sketch entity. *
Specifying only the base sketch entity and automatically including connected entities. The
base sketch entity should be specified as the only item in the collection. The
IncludeConnectedEntities boolean argument should be specified as True to indicate that all
entities that form a loop (open or closed) which contains the base sketch entity should be
automatically included to be offset.
Since only one of the above options to specify a group of connected entities can be used at
the same time and not both, if the collection contains multiple entities, it implies that the
collection is being used to explicitly specify an exact set of sketch entities to offset, in which
case the IncludeConnectedEntities argument should be False. If True is specified, the
method will fail and the sketch entities will not be offset.
OffsetPoint Point2d Defines a point on the sketch through which the offset of the base sketch entity (the sketch
entity specified by the first item in the SketchEntities collection) should pass. The shortest
SketchBlockDefinitionProxy Object Page 24 of 38
file:///C:/Users/Cliente/AppData/Local/Temp/~hhB011.htm 17/06/2025
distance of this point from the base sketch entity is used to determine the offset distance.
This offset distance will also be used to offset any other additional connected sketch entities.
The location of the point with respect to the base sketch entity determines the position of the
offset base sketch entity (i.e. the location of the point determines on which side of the base
sketch entity the offset of the base sketch entity will be positioned). Once the offset distance
and position for the offset of the base sketch entity are determined, this information is used
to determine the position for all other connected sketch entities that need to be offset. Thus,
the offset point provides sufficient information to calculate the offset distance as well as the
offset direction for all the sketch entities that need to be offset.
IncludeConnectedEntities Boolean
Value that specifies whether all entities that form a loop containing the base sketch entity
should also be offset. If True is specified, then all loop entities will be offset. But, if the
sketch has multiple loops that contain the base sketch entity in which case it will not be
possible to uniquely determine a single loop that needs to be offset, only the base sketch
entity will be offset. If False is specified, then only the entities specified in the
SketchEntities collection will be offset. If True is specified, the SketchEntities collection
should contain only one item that corresponds to the base sketch entity, otherwise, if the
SketchEntities collection contains multiple entities, then this method will fail and the sketch
entities will not be offset. If False is specified, the SketchEntities collection can contain
either a single item that corresponds to the base sketch entity or multiple items that
correspond to a group of end\-to\-end connected entities. If the collection contains a single
item that corresponds to the base sketch entity, then only this base sketch entity will be
offset. On the other hand, if the collection contains multiple items, it implies that the
collection is being used to specify an exact set of sketch entities to offset, hence, only those
exact set of sketch entities will be offset. If no value is specified for this argument, then a
default value of False will be assumed.
This is an optional argument whose default value is False.
CreateOffsetConstraints Boolean
Value that specifies whether offset constraints between the original and offset entities should
be automatically created. If True is specified, then offset constraints will be automatically
created. If False is specified, then offset constraints will not be created. If no value is
specified, then a default value of True will be assumed to indicate that the offset constraints
will be automatically created.
This is an optional argument whose default value is True.

Samples
Name Description
SurfaceBody Copy
This sample demonstrates copying a surface body from one part to another.
This is equivalent to the Promote command, but the API is much more
flexible. In order for the sample to be self-contained, it creates two parts on
the fly that will be used to demonstrate copying a body from one part to
another. When copying a body into a part, you provide the surface body and a
matrix to define its position in the new part. This sample creates a matrix
based on the position of these parts within an assembly.

SketchControlPointSpline Object
Derived from: SketchEntity Object
Description
The SketchControlPointSpline object represents a control point spline within a sketch. These splines are
created by defining the vertices of a control polygon of a NURBS curve. The properties and methods listed
below are in addition to those supported by the SketchEntity object.
Methods
Name Description
ConvertToSpline Method that inserts a new control point into the existing control point spline.
Delete
Method that deletes the sketch entity. This method will fail in the case where this object
was created as a result of a derived part. The HasReferenceComponent property can be
used to determine when this is the case.
GetCustomLineType
Method that returns information regarding the custom line type in use. The method
returns a failure if the return value of the LineType property is not kCustomLineType.
GetReferenceKey Method that generates and returns the reference key for this entity.
InsertKnot
Method that inserts a knot into the existing control point spline. The effect of this will
be that the shape of the curve is maintained, but the control polygon will change shape
and one additional point will be added.
SetCustomLineType
Method that sets a custom line type to the curve from the specified .lin file. The method
automatically changes the value of LineType property to kCustomLineType.
Properties
Name Description
Application
Returns the top-level parent application object. When used the context of Inventor,
an Application object is returned. When used in the context of Apprentice, an
ApprenticeServer object is returned.
AttributeSets Property that returns the AttributeSets collection object associated with this object.
Constraints
Property that returns a collection of sketch constraints that are tied directly to this
entity. This collection consists of both geometric and dimension constraints.
ConstraintStatus
Read-only property that returns the constraint status of the sketch. Possible return
values are kFullyConstrainedConstraintStatus, kOverConstrainedConstraintStatus,
kUnderConstrainedConstraintStatus, and kUnknownConstraintStatus.
Construction Gets and sets whether the entity behaves as a construction entity or not.
ContainingSketchBlock
Property that returns the sketch block that contains this object. This is the same
SketchBlock returned as the last item in the SketchBlockPath property. This
property returns Nothing if this object does not belong to a sketch block and lives
directly under a sketch.
ControlPoint
Read-only property that returns the SketchPoint at the specified index. The indices
correspond to the control points in order from the start to the end of the spline. An
Index of 1 returns the first SketchPoint. The ControlPointCount property returns the
total number of control points for the spline. Deleting the returned sketch point will
delete the control point from the spline.
ControlPointCount
Read-only property that returns the number of control points defining the control
point spline.
ControlPolygonSide
SketchControlPointSpline Object Page 1 of 21
file:///C:/Users/Cliente/AppData/Local/Temp/~hh16FA.htm 17/06/2025
Read-only property that returns the SketchLine that represents a side of the control
polygon. The indices correspond to the control polygon edges in order from the
start to the end of the spline. An Index of 1 returns the first edge, with the last side
being ControlPointCount -1 since there is one less side than number of control
points.
CurvatureDisplay Specifies whether curvature information is displayed for the spline.
DisabledActionTypes Gets and sets whether specific user actions are blocked on this sketch geometry.
EndSketchPoint
Read-only property that returns the sketch point that defines the position of the end
of the spline.
Geometry
Read-only property that returns a BSplineCurve2d geometry object. The object
returned represents a 'snapshot' view of the current state of the spline.
Geometry3d
Read-only property that returns b-spline geometry that represents this spline in
model space.
HasReferenceComponent Property that specifies if the object was created as the result of a derived part.
IsClosed Read-only property that returns whether the curve is closed.
Layer Gets and sets the layer applied to this sketch entity.
Length Returns the length of the entity in centimeters.
LineDefinitionSpace Gets and sets the LineDefinitionSpace applied to this sketch spline.
LineScale Gets and sets the LineScale applied to this sketch spline.
LineType Gets and sets the LineType applied to this sketch spline.
LineWeight Gets and sets the LineWeight applied to this entity.
OverrideColor Gets and sets the color applied to this sketch spline.
OwnedBy Indicates entity or entities that own this object.
Parent Property that returns the parent sketch of the entity.
RangeBox
Property that returns a Box2D object which contains the lower-left and upper-right

Remarks
Sketch changes that fire this event include adding new geometry, modifying existing geometry
either directly or indirectly by editing dimension constraints, deleting geometry, and placing or
deleting constraints where it will cause a change in any geometry. For example, placing a
perpendicular constraint between two lines will cause this notification to be sent if the orientation
of the lines needs to be changed to make them perpendicular. If the lines are already positioned
perpendicular to one another, adding the constraint will not cause this notification to fire since the
geometry does not change. Deleting the constraint does not cause the notification to be sent since
the geometry is not changed as a result. Adding dimension constraints does not change the
geometry so it does not result in this notification being sent, but editing the value of the dimension
does modify the geometry and will result in this notification being sent.

Description
Method that creates a new sketch line based on the two input points. The new sketch line is
returned.
Syntax
SketchLines3D.AddByTwoPoints( StartPoint As Object, EndPoint As Object, [UseAutoBend]
As Boolean, [BendRadius] As Variant ) As SketchLine3D
Parameters
Name Type Description
StartPoint Object
Input object that defines the start point of the line. This can be either a
vertex object, a workpoint, a SketchPoint, or an existing SketchPoint3D
object. If an existing sketch point is input, that point becomes the line's
start point.
EndPoint Object
Input object that defines the end point of the line. This can be either a
vertex object, a workpoint, a SketchPoint, or an existing SketchPoint3D
object. If an existing sketch point is input, that point becomes the line's
end point.
UseAutoBend Boolean
Optional input Boolean that indicates whether a bend should be
automatically applied if the StartPoint or the EndPoint is shared by
another sketch line. The default is True, which means that the bend will
be automatically applied.
This is an optional argument whose default value is True.
BendRadius Variant
Optional input variant that defines the radius of the auto-bend. If the
UseAutoBend flag is set to true and this variant is not supplied, a default
value is used for the bend radius. This can be either a numeric value or a
string. A parameter for this value will be created and the supplied string
or value is assigned to the parameter. If a value is input, the units are
centimeters. If a string is input, the units can be specified as part of the
string or it will default to the current length units of the document.
This is an optional argument whose default value is null.

Section
This sample demonstrates the creation of a loft feature. It uses two sections for
the loft, one is from a 2d sketch and the other is a non-planar section from a 3d
sketch. Because one of the sketches isn't planar, a surface is created instead of
a solid.

SketchPoint Object
Derived from: SketchEntity Object
Description
The SketchPoint object represents a point within a sketch. See the article in the overviews section.
Methods
Name Description
Delete
Method that deletes the sketch entity. This method will fail in the case where
this object was created as a result of a derived part. The
HasReferenceComponent property can be used to determine when this is the
case.
GetReferenceKey Method that generates and returns the reference key for this entity.
Merge
Method that merges this sketch point with the input sketch point. Any objects
dependent on this sketch point will change their dependency to the new sketch
point.
MoveBy
Method that moves the sketch point a delta distance from its current location.
Movement of a sketch point is limited by the constraints currently defined on
the sketch. If a sketch is partially constrained it will perform the move within
the range allowed by the constraints. Because of this, the result of a move may
not always be exactly what was specified.
MoveTo
Method that moves the sketch point to an explicit X-Y location. Movement of
a sketch point is limited by the constraints currently defined on the sketch. If a
sketch is partially constrained it will perform the move within the range
allowed by the constraints. Because of this, the result of a move may not
always be exactly what was specified.

Name Description
Add a punch tool
feature
This program demonstrates the creation of a punch tool feature. It uses one
of the punch features that's delivered with Inventor. It assumes you already
have an existing sheet metal part and have selected a face to place the punch
feature on. The selected face should be large so there is room for the punch
features.
This sample illustrates creating a new sketched symbol definition object and
inserting it into the active sheet.

The SketchPoint3D object represents a point within a 3D sketch. See the article in the overviews
section.
Methods
Name Description
ConnectTo
Method that connects this sketch point to the input point. Valid inputs are
SketchPoint3D, SketchPoint, Vertex or WorkPoint. This method is the UI
equivalent of 'Add Coincident Constraint'. The point being constrained is the
sketch point on which this method is called and the input point is the
constraining point. This method will fail if a coincident constraint exists
between this sketch point and a vertex; i.e. this sketch point must be
underconstrained.
Delete Method that deletes the sketch entity.
GetReferenceKey Method that generates and returns the reference key for this entity.
MoveBy
Method that moves the sketch point a delta distance from its current location.
Movement of a sketch point is limited by the constraints currently defined on
the sketch. If a sketch is partially constrained it will perform the move within
the range allowed by the constraints. Because of this, the result of a move may
not always be exactly what was specified.

creation of this feature.
ReferencedEntity
Property that returns the object this entity is dependent on. When
sketch entities are created by projecting model edges or intersecting the
model, the resulting entities are driven by the original model entities
and cannot be modified. This property returns the model entity the
sketch entity is dependent on. The Reference property indicates
whether the sketch entity is driven by a model entity or not. If the
sketch entity is not referencing a model entity, this property will return
Nothing. This property can also return nothing even when the sketch
entity is referencing a model entity in the case where the model entity
has been consumed by some subsequent modeling operation.
Type Returns an ObjectTypeEnum indicating this object's type.

SketchPoint3DProxy.ReferencedEntity
Property
Parent Object: SketchPoint3DProxy
Description
Property that returns the object this entity is dependent on. When sketch entities are created by
projecting model edges or intersecting the model, the resulting entities are driven by the original
model entities and cannot be modified. This property returns the model entity the sketch entity is
dependent on. The Reference property indicates whether the sketch entity is driven by a model
entity or not. If the sketch entity is not referencing a model entity, this property will return Nothing.
This property can also return nothing even when the sketch entity is referencing a model entity in
the case where the model entity has been consumed by some subsequent modeling operation.

SketchPointProxy Object
Derived from: SketchPoint Object
Description
This is an assembly-context proxy object derived from its native definition-context object.
Methods
Name Description
Delete
Method that deletes the sketch entity. This method will fail in the case where
this object was created as a result of a derived part. The
HasReferenceComponent property can be used to determine when this is the
case.
GetReferenceKey Method that generates and returns the reference key for this entity.
Merge
Method that merges this sketch point with the input sketch point. Any objects
dependent on this sketch point will change their dependency to the new sketch
point.
MoveBy
Method that moves the sketch point a delta distance from its current location.
Movement of a sketch point is limited by the constraints currently defined on
the sketch. If a sketch is partially constrained it will perform the move within
the range allowed by the constraints. Because of this, the result of a move may
not always be exactly what was specified.
MoveTo
Method that moves the sketch point to an explicit X-Y location. Movement of
a sketch point is limited by the constraints currently defined on the sketch. If a
sketch is partially constrained it will perform the move within the range
allowed by the constraints. Because of this, the result of a move may not
always be exactly what was specified.

Parent Object: Style
Description
Method that generates and returns the reference key for this entity.
Syntax
Style.GetReferenceKey( ReferenceKey() As Byte, [KeyContext] As Long )
Parameters
Name Type Description
ReferenceKey Byte Input/output array of Bytes that contains the reference key.
KeyContext Long
Input Long that specifies the key context. The key context must be supplied
when working with any B-Rep entities (and SurfaceBody, FaceShell, Face,
Edge, EdgeUse and Vertex objects). A key context is created using the
CreateKeyContext method of the ReferenceKeyManager object. For all
other object types, the key context argument is not used and is ignored if
provided.
This is an optional argument whose default value is 0.
Remarks
The reference key is an array of bytes that can be used as a persistent reference for this entity. To
obtain the entity at a later time using the reference key you use the BindKeyToObject method of
the object. The ReferenceKeyManager object is obtained using the ReferenceKeyManager
property of the Document object.

SurfaceBody
Copy
This sample demonstrates copying a surface body from one part to another. This is
equivalent to the Promote command, but the API is much more flexible. In order
for the sample to be self-contained, it creates two parts on the fly that will be used
to demonstrate copying a body from one part to another. When copying a body
into a part, you provide the surface body and a matrix to define its position in the
new part. This sample creates a matrix based on the position of these parts within
an assembly.

Methods
Name Description
BindTransientKeyToObject Bind the transient key of a subentity on this body to a live object.
CalculateFacets
Obtain the facetted representation for the given chord-height tolerance. If stored facets available for this tolerance, then
those are returned.
CalculateFacetsAndTextureMap
Obtain the facetted representation for the given chord-height tolerance. If stored facets available for this tolerance, then
those are returned.
CalculateFacetsWithOptions Method that creates a new set of facets within the specified conditions.
CalculateStrokes
Obtain the stroked or polygonal representation for the given chord-height tolerance. Client to deallocate pointers with
CoTaskMemFree.
CalculateStrokesWithOptions Method that creates a new set of strokes within the specified conditions.
ClearAppearanceOverrides
Method that clears all the appearance overrides that have been applied to faces or features in the body. When the
SurfaceBody has its IsSolid return True, this method sets the AppearanceSourceType to kBodyAppearance for all the
features and kFeatureAppearance for all the faces in the body. When the SurfaceBody has its IsSolid return False, this
method sets the AppearanceSourceType to kBodyAppearance for all the features directly owned by the work surface
and kFeatureAppearance for all the faces in the body.
Delete Method that deletes this SurfaceBody object.
FindUsingRay
Please note: As of Autodesk Inventor 5.3 Service Pack 2, the FindUsingRay method below has superseded
LocateUsingRay. Please update your applications accordingly. Method that fires a ray through the part or assembly and
returns the entities intersected by the ray. The objects intersected by the ray are returned in the order in which they are
intersected, with the first entities returned being those closest to the clipping plane. There is also a precedence in the
type of entities returned. The entities returned can be Vertex, Edge, or Face objects. The precedence is in that order. If
the ray intersects a vertex, then that vertex is returned and none of the edges or faces that connect to that vertex are
returned. If the ray intersects an edge, then that edge is returned and none of the faces that connect to the edge are
returned. If the ray intersects a face, then that face is returned. If desired, you can use the functionality provided by the
B-Rep portion of the API to obtain the various associated objects from the entity returned. For example if you need a
face but an edge is returned, you can use the Faces property of the Edge object to get the associated faces. The start
point defines the physical starting point from which to determine intersections. Any intersections behind the start point
are ignored. However, the ray is infinite from the start point, so all intersections in the direction of the ray will be
returned.
GetAppearanceTextureMappingData Gets the texture mapping type and alignment.
GetExistingFacets
Obtain the faceted representation for the given chord-height tolerance as. Fails if the tolerance supplied is not preexisting/
GetExistingFacetsAndTextureMap
Method that returns the specified set of existing display facets. Existing display facets are stored to single-precision
floating point accuracy. This is typically adequate accuracy for display purposes. If a more accurate result is required
you can use the CalculateFacets method which will calculate new facets to a given tolerance at double-precision
accuracy.
GetExistingFacetTolerances
Method that gets the tolerances that were used to calculate the existing sets of display facets. These can be used to
determine if any existing facets have been calculated within your desired accuracy. The tolerance value is also used as
an index to specify which set of existing facets to retrieve when using the GetExistingFacets method.
GetExistingStrokes
Method that returns the specified set of strokes from the SurfaceBody, Face or Edge the method was called from.
Existing strokes are stored to single-precision floating point accuracy. This is typically adequate accuracy for display
purposes. If a more accurate result is required you can use the CalculateStrokes method, which will calculate new
strokes to a given tolerance at double-precision accuracy. If you are using this method within Apprentice, you can use
the DisplayAffinity property to optimize Apprentice for access to strokes. Setting this property to True before you
begin to traverse an assembly notifies Apprentice not to load any B-rep entities.
GetExistingStrokeTolerances
Method that gets the tolerances that were used to calculate the existing sets of display strokes. These can be used to
determine if any existing strokes have been calculated within your desired accuracy. The tolerance value is also used as
an index to specify which set of existing strokes to retrieve when using the GetExistingStrokes method. If you are using
this method within Apprentice, you can use the DisplayAffinity property to optimize Apprentice for access to strokes.
Setting this property to True before you begin to traverse an assembly notifies Apprentice not to load any B-rep
entities.
GetFaceColors
Method that gets the appearance colors for the faces. The returned ObjectCollection contains the Color objects with the
same sequence as the corresponding Face objects in the input Faces argument.
GetReferenceKey Method that generates and returns the reference key for this entity.
IsEntityValid Method that returns whether an entity passes the quality check at the specified level.
LocateUsingPoint
Finds the object of specified type within the proximity of the given point. By default an internal tolerance is used to
gauge the proximity.
SetAppearanceTextureMappingData
Method that sets the texture mapping type and alignment. Setting this value is only valid when the appearance assigned
to the body has a texture defined.

SurfaceBody Copy
This sample demonstrates copying a surface body from one part to another. This is equivalent to the Promote command, but the API is
much more flexible. In order for the sample to be self-contained, it creates two parts on the fly that will be used to demonstrate copying
a body from one part to another. When copying a body into a part, you provide the surface body and a matrix to define its position in
the new part. This sample creates a matrix based on the position of these parts within an assembly.
Client graphics
texture-based color
mapping
This test applies texture coordinates expressing distance from the origin to 'the triangle mesh of whatever Part you have open. It then
creates either a discrete-band or continuous color mapper and allows you to adjust the values of the mapper to change the range of
values that map to various colors.

Syntax
SurfaceBody.CalculateFacets( Tolerance As Double, VertexCount As Long, FacetCount As Long, VertexCoordinates() As Double, NormalVectors() As
Double, VertexIndices() As Long )
Parameters
SurfaceBody Object Page 5 of 24
file:///C:/Users/Cliente/AppData/Local/Temp/~hhB819.htm 17/06/2025
Name Type Description
Tolerance Double
Input Double that specifies the maximum distance that the facet can deviate from the smooth surface. This value is in
centimeters. Smaller values can result in a much greater number of facets being returned and will require more processing time to
calculate.
The picture below illustrates how the chordal tolerance is used when creating a stroked version of a curve. The chordal tolerance
defines the maximum distance a line can be from the actual curve. When calculating facets the same concept applies but it
defines the maximum distance between a triangle facet and the smooth surface.
The pictures below illustrate the difference obtained when calculating facets for a model using different chordal tolerances. The
overall size of this model is approx. 6x6x4 cm’s. The picture on the left used a chordal tolerance of 0.1 cm and the one on the
right used a tolerance of 0.01 cm.
VertexCount Long
Output Long that returns the number of vertices that were generated. This is the number of vertices that will be returned by the
VertexCoordinates argument.
FacetCount Long Output Long that returns the number of facets that were generated.
VertexCoordinates Double
Output array of Doubles that contains the coordinate locations of the vertices. The values are defined in x, y, z order within the
array and represent coordinates within the model space of the faceted object.
NormalVectors Double
Output array of Doubles that defines the normal for each vertex in the facet mesh. The values are defined in x, y, z order within
the array and represent vector components within the model space of the faceted object.
VertexIndices Long
Output array of Longs that are used as index values to index into the vertex coordinate list. The first coordinate in the vertex
coordinate list is index 1. Using vertex indices allows vertex coordinates to be reused by more than one triangle, thus reducing the
overall resources required to define the entire mesh.
Remarks
Note that CalculateFacets and GetExistingFacets (or GetExistingTolerances) are completely unrelated other than they both deal in facet data. CalculateFacets
facets the model and returns that result. It does not effect any information held by Inventor. It is just direct access to the internal facet generator. The
GetExistingFacets/Tolerances methods access the existing facet data held by the internal scene, if any. They access the set of existing tolerances and facets
currently being held. Therefore it is quite possible that existing facets at a given tolerance may not exactly match calculated facets at the same tolerance.

SurfaceBody.FindUsingRay Method
Parent Object: SurfaceBody
Description
Please note: As of Autodesk Inventor 5.3 Service Pack 2, the FindUsingRay method below has superseded LocateUsingRay. Please update your applications
accordingly. Method that fires a ray through the part or assembly and returns the entities intersected by the ray. The objects intersected by the ray are returned
in the order in which they are intersected, with the first entities returned being those closest to the clipping plane. There is also a precedence in the type of
entities returned. The entities returned can be Vertex, Edge, or Face objects. The precedence is in that order. If the ray intersects a vertex, then that vertex is
returned and none of the edges or faces that connect to that vertex are returned. If the ray intersects an edge, then that edge is returned and none of the faces
that connect to the edge are returned. If the ray intersects a face, then that face is returned. If desired, you can use the functionality provided by the B-Rep
portion of the API to obtain the various associated objects from the entity returned. For example if you need a face but an edge is returned, you can use the
Faces property of the Edge object to get the associated faces. The start point defines the physical starting point from which to determine intersections. Any
intersections behind the start point are ignored. However, the ray is infinite from the start point, so all intersections in the direction of the ray will be returned.
Syntax
SurfaceBody.FindUsingRay( RayStartPoint As Point, RayDirection As UnitVector, Radius As Double, FoundEntities As ObjectsEnumerator,
LocationPoints As ObjectsEnumerator, [FindFirstOnly] As Boolean )
Parameters
Name Type Description
RayStartPoint Point Input Point object that defines the start point of the ray in model space.
RayDirection UnitVector Input UnitVector object that defines the direction of the ray. The ray is infinite in the direction defined.
Radius Double
Input Double that defines the radius of the ray. This value is specified in centimeters. Defining a radius for a ray allows
the intersection to be within a given tolerance. This radius essentially results in the definition of a cylinder whose axis
lies along the axis defined by the RayStartPoint and RayDirection. The intersection result is between the cylinder and the
model's entities. A value higher than zero is recommended, though not explicitly required.
FoundEntities ObjectsEnumerator Output ObjectsEnumerator that returns the entities that were intersected by the ray.
LocationPoints ObjectsEnumerator
Output ObjectsEnumerator that returns a set of Point objects. One Point object is returned for each entity in the
FoundEntities list. The point defines the coordinate of the intersection between the ray and the corresponding entity.
FindFirstOnly Boolean
Optional input Boolean that specifies whether to find just the first entity in the ray's path. If False (the default) then all
entities found are returned.
This is an optional argument whose default value is False.

Syntax
SurfaceBody.GetExistingFacets( ToleranceIndex As Double, VertexCount As Long, FacetCount As Long, VertexCoordinates() As Double,
NormalVectors() As Double, VertexIndices() As Long )
Parameters
Name Type Description
ToleranceIndex Double
Input Double that serves as an index as to which set of existing facets you want to retrieve. If the input tolerance does not match
an existing set an error will occur. The tolerances for existing facets can be obtained using the GetExistingFacetTolerances
method.
VertexCount Long
Output Long that returns the number of vertices that were generated for the facets. This is the number of vertices that will be
returned by the VertexCoordinates argument.
FacetCount Long Output Long that returns the number of facets that were generated.
VertexCoordinates Double Output array of Doubles that contains the coordinates of the vertices.
NormalVectors Double
Output array of Singles that contains the components of the vertex normals. A normal is returned for each vertex. The normal is
the normal of the actual surface at the position of the vertex.
VertexIndices Long
Output array of Longs that are used to index into the vertex coordinates array. These indices provide the information that defines
how the vertices are connected to create the triangular facets.
Remarks
Note that CalculateFacets and GetExistingFacets (or GetExistingTolerances) are completely unrelated other than they both deal in facet data. CalculateFacets
facets the model and returns that result. It does not effect any information held by Inventor. It is just direct access to the internal facet generator. The
GetExistingFacets/Tolerances methods access the existing facet data held by the internal scene, if any. They access the set of existing tolerances and facets
currently being held. Therefore it is quite possible that existing facets at a given tolerance may not exactly match calculated facets at the same tolerance.

SurfaceBody.GetExistingFacetsAndTextureMap Method
Parent Object: SurfaceBody
Description
Method that returns the specified set of existing display facets. Existing display facets are stored to single-precision floating point accuracy. This is typically
adequate accuracy for display purposes. If a more accurate result is required you can use the CalculateFacets method which will calculate new facets to a
given tolerance at double-precision accuracy.
Syntax
SurfaceBody.GetExistingFacetsAndTextureMap( ToleranceIndex As Double, VertexCount As Long, FacetCount As Long, VertexCoordinates() As
Double, NormalVectors() As Double, VertexIndices() As Long, TextureCoordinates() As Double )
Parameters
Name Type Description
ToleranceIndex Double
Input Double that serves as an index as to which set of existing facets you want to retrieve. If the input tolerance does not match
an existing set an error will occur. The tolerances for existing facets can be obtained using the GetExistingFacetTolerances
method.
VertexCount Long
Output Long that returns the number of vertices that were generated for the facets. This is the number of vertices that will be
returned by the VertexCoordinates argument.
FacetCount Long Output Long that returns the number of facets that were generated.
VertexCoordinates Double Output array of Doubles that contains the coordinates of the vertices.
NormalVectors Double
Output array of Singles that contains the components of the vertex normals. A normal is returned for each vertex. The normal is
the normal of the actual surface at the position of the vertex.
VertexIndices Long
Output array of Longs that are used to index into the vertex coordinates array. These indices provide the information that defines
how the vertices are connected to create the triangular facets.
TextureCoordinates Double Output array of Doubles that contains the coordinates of the texture.
Remarks
Note that CalculateFacets and GetExistingFacets (or GetExistingTolerances) are completely unrelated other than they both deal in facet data. CalculateFacets
facets the model and returns that result. It does not effect any information held by Inventor. It is just direct access to the internal facet generator. The

SurfaceBody.GetExistingFacetTolerances Method
Parent Object: SurfaceBody
Description
Method that gets the tolerances that were used to calculate the existing sets of display facets. These can be used to determine if any existing facets have been
calculated within your desired accuracy. The tolerance value is also used as an index to specify which set of existing facets to retrieve when using the
GetExistingFacets method.
Syntax
SurfaceBody.GetExistingFacetTolerances( ToleranceCount As Long, ExistingTolerances() As Double )
Parameters
Name Type Description
ToleranceCount Long Output Long that specifies the number of existing facet sets.
ExistingTolerances Double Output array of Doubles that contains the tolerances that were used to compute the existing sets of display facets.
Remarks
If you are using this method within Apprentice, you can use the DisplayAffinity property to optimize Apprentice for access to facets. Setting this property to
True before you begin to traverse an assembly notifies Apprentice not to load any B-rep entities. Note that CalculateFacets and GetExistingFacets (or
GetExistingTolerances) are completely unrelated other than they both deal in facet data. CalculateFacets facets the model and returns that result. It does not
effect any information held by Inventor. It is just direct access to the \internal facet generator. The GetExistingFacets/Tolerances methods access the existing

SurfaceBody.GetExistingStrokes Method
Parent Object: SurfaceBody
Description
Method that returns the specified set of strokes from the SurfaceBody, Face or Edge the method was called from. Existing strokes are stored to singleprecision
floating point accuracy. This is typically adequate accuracy for display purposes. If a more accurate result is required you can use the
CalculateStrokes method, which will calculate new strokes to a given tolerance at double-precision accuracy. If you are using this method within Apprentice,
you can use the DisplayAffinity property to optimize Apprentice for access to strokes. Setting this property to True before you begin to traverse an assembly
notifies Apprentice not to load any B-rep entities.

Description
Property that returns a constant indicating whether the specified point is inside, on or outside the body.
Syntax
SurfaceBody.IsPointInside( Point() As Double, [UseBox] As Boolean ) As ContainmentEnum
Property Value
This is a read only property whose value is a ContainmentEnum.
Parameters
Name Type Description
Point Double Point whose location to determine.
UseBox Boolean
Optional input Boolean that specifies whether to use a box to determine if the point is inside, on or outside of the body. Sometimes one
wants to avoid the creation of bounding boxes during intermediate steps of a construction because the creation of bounding boxes can be
costly. If you're applying multiple operations to a body then the bounding box of some of the shells would be invalid after each operation.
You wouldn't want to use the bounding box during these intermediate stages because you might spend more time computing the bounding
box than you'd save by using it for trivial rejection. On the other hand, if you have a stable body and a high likelihood that the bounding
box is up-to-date, then it might save some time to set the use_box parameter to true.
This is an optional argument whose default value is True.

PrecisionPercent Double
Input Double that specifies the requested relative accuracy of the result as a percentage. For example, a value of 0.01 requests a
maximum error of one percent. The application should find the mass properties for several requested accuracies and compare the
results since there is a limitation to the current algorithm in that it does have a bound on how precisely the algorithm can calculate
mass properties, due to hard coded convergence criteria in the functions. If you tighten the relative error value and the mass
properties values don't change, that means it is as close as can be achieved.

SurfaceBodyProxy Object
Derived from: SurfaceBody Object
Description
This is an assembly-context proxy object derived from its native definition-context object.
Methods
Name Description
BindTransientKeyToObject Bind the transient key of a subentity on this body to a live object.
CalculateFacets
Obtain the facetted representation for the given chord-height tolerance. If stored facets available for this tolerance, then
those are returned.
CalculateFacetsAndTextureMap
Obtain the facetted representation for the given chord-height tolerance. If stored facets available for this tolerance, then
those are returned.
CalculateFacetsWithOptions Method that creates a new set of facets within the specified conditions.
CalculateStrokes
Obtain the stroked or polygonal representation for the given chord-height tolerance. Client to deallocate pointers with
CoTaskMemFree.
CalculateStrokesWithOptions Method that creates a new set of strokes within the specified conditions.
ClearAppearanceOverrides
Method that clears all the appearance overrides that have been applied to faces or features in the body. When the
SurfaceBody has its IsSolid return True, this method sets the AppearanceSourceType to kBodyAppearance for all the
features and kFeatureAppearance for all the faces in the body. When the SurfaceBody has its IsSolid return False, this
method sets the AppearanceSourceType to kBodyAppearance for all the features directly owned by the work surface
and kFeatureAppearance for all the faces in the body.
Delete Method that deletes this SurfaceBody object.
FindUsingRay
Please note: As of Autodesk Inventor 5.3 Service Pack 2, the FindUsingRay method below has superseded
LocateUsingRay. Please update your applications accordingly. Method that fires a ray through the part or assembly and
returns the entities intersected by the ray. The objects intersected by the ray are returned in the order in which they are
intersected, with the first entities returned being those closest to the clipping plane. There is also a precedence in the
type of entities returned. The entities returned can be Vertex, Edge, or Face objects. The precedence is in that order. If
the ray intersects a vertex, then that vertex is returned and none of the edges or faces that connect to that vertex are
returned. If the ray intersects an edge, then that edge is returned and none of the faces that connect to the edge are
returned. If the ray intersects a face, then that face is returned. If desired, you can use the functionality provided by the
B-Rep portion of the API to obtain the various associated objects from the entity returned. For example if you need a
face but an edge is returned, you can use the Faces property of the Edge object to get the associated faces. The start
point defines the physical starting point from which to determine intersections. Any intersections behind the start point
are ignored. However, the ray is infinite from the start point, so all intersections in the direction of the ray will be
returned.
GetAppearanceTextureMappingData Gets the texture mapping type and alignment.
GetExistingFacets
Obtain the faceted representation for the given chord-height tolerance as. Fails if the tolerance supplied is not preexisting/
GetExistingFacetsAndTextureMap
Method that returns the specified set of existing display facets. Existing display facets are stored to single-precision
floating point accuracy. This is typically adequate accuracy for display purposes. If a more accurate result is required
you can use the CalculateFacets method which will calculate new facets to a given tolerance at double-precision
accuracy.
GetExistingFacetTolerances
Method that gets the tolerances that were used to calculate the existing sets of display facets. These can be used to
determine if any existing facets have been calculated within your desired accuracy. The tolerance value is also used as
an index to specify which set of existing facets to retrieve when using the GetExistingFacets method.
GetExistingStrokes
Method that returns the specified set of strokes from the SurfaceBody, Face or Edge the method was called from.
Existing strokes are stored to single-precision floating point accuracy. This is typically adequate accuracy for display
purposes. If a more accurate result is required you can use the CalculateStrokes method, which will calculate new
strokes to a given tolerance at double-precision accuracy. If you are using this method within Apprentice, you can use
the DisplayAffinity property to optimize Apprentice for access to strokes. Setting this property to True before you
begin to traverse an assembly notifies Apprentice not to load any B-rep entities.
GetExistingStrokeTolerances
Method that gets the tolerances that were used to calculate the existing sets of display strokes. These can be used to
determine if any existing strokes have been calculated within your desired accuracy. The tolerance value is also used as
an index to specify which set of existing strokes to retrieve when using the GetExistingStrokes method. If you are using
this method within Apprentice, you can use the DisplayAffinity property to optimize Apprentice for access to strokes.
Setting this property to True before you begin to traverse an assembly notifies Apprentice not to load any B-rep
entities.
GetFaceColors
Method that gets the appearance colors for the faces. The returned ObjectCollection contains the Color objects with the
same sequence as the corresponding Face objects in the input Faces argument.
GetReferenceKey Method that generates and returns the reference key for this entity.
IsEntityValid Method that returns whether an entity passes the quality check at the specified level.
LocateUsingPoint
Finds the object of specified type within the proximity of the given point. By default an internal tolerance is used to
gauge the proximity.
SetAppearanceTextureMappingData
Method that sets the texture mapping type and alignment. Setting this value is only valid when the appearance assigned
to the body has a texture defined.

Description
Obtain the facetted representation for the given chord-height tolerance. If stored facets available for this tolerance, then those are returned.
Syntax
SurfaceBodyProxy.CalculateFacets( Tolerance As Double, VertexCount As Long, FacetCount As Long, VertexCoordinates() As Double, NormalVectors
() As Double, VertexIndices() As Long )
Parameters
Name Type Description
Tolerance Double
Input Double that specifies the maximum distance that the facet can deviate from the smooth surface. This value is in
centimeters. Smaller values can result in a much greater number of facets being returned and will require more processing time to
calculate.
The picture below illustrates how the chordal tolerance is used when creating a stroked version of a curve. The chordal tolerance
defines the maximum distance a line can be from the actual curve. When calculating facets the same concept applies but it
defines the maximum distance between a triangle facet and the smooth surface.
The pictures below illustrate the difference obtained when calculating facets for a model using different chordal tolerances. The
overall size of this model is approx. 6x6x4 cm’s. The picture on the left used a chordal tolerance of 0.1 cm and the one on the
right used a tolerance of 0.01 cm.
VertexCount Long
Output Long that returns the number of vertices that were generated. This is the number of vertices that will be returned by the
VertexCoordinates argument.
FacetCount Long Output Long that returns the number of facets that were generated.
VertexCoordinates Double
Output array of Doubles that contains the coordinate locations of the vertices. The values are defined in x, y, z order within the
array and represent coordinates within the model space of the faceted object.
NormalVectors Double Output array of Doubles that defines the normal for each vertex in the facet mesh. The values are defined in x, y, z order within
the array and represent vector components within the model space of the faceted object.

VertexIndices Long
Output array of Longs that are used as index values to index into the vertex coordinate list. The first coordinate in the vertex
coordinate list is index 1. Using vertex indices allows vertex coordinates to be reused by more than one triangle, thus reducing the
overall resources required to define the entire mesh.

SurfaceBodyProxy.FindUsingRay Method
Parent Object: SurfaceBodyProxy
Description
Please note: As of Autodesk Inventor 5.3 Service Pack 2, the FindUsingRay method below has superseded LocateUsingRay. Please update your applications
accordingly. Method that fires a ray through the part or assembly and returns the entities intersected by the ray. The objects intersected by the ray are returned
in the order in which they are intersected, with the first entities returned being those closest to the clipping plane. There is also a precedence in the type of
entities returned. The entities returned can be Vertex, Edge, or Face objects. The precedence is in that order. If the ray intersects a vertex, then that vertex is
returned and none of the edges or faces that connect to that vertex are returned. If the ray intersects an edge, then that edge is returned and none of the faces
that connect to the edge are returned. If the ray intersects a face, then that face is returned. If desired, you can use the functionality provided by the B-Rep
portion of the API to obtain the various associated objects from the entity returned. For example if you need a face but an edge is returned, you can use the
Faces property of the Edge object to get the associated faces. The start point defines the physical starting point from which to determine intersections. Any
intersections behind the start point are ignored. However, the ray is infinite from the start point, so all intersections in the direction of the ray will be returned.
Syntax
SurfaceBodyProxy.FindUsingRay( RayStartPoint As Point, RayDirection As UnitVector, Radius As Double, FoundEntities As ObjectsEnumerator,
LocationPoints As ObjectsEnumerator, [FindFirstOnly] As Boolean )
Parameters
Name Type Description
RayStartPoint Point Input Point object that defines the start point of the ray in model space.
RayDirection UnitVector Input UnitVector object that defines the direction of the ray. The ray is infinite in the direction defined.
Radius Double
Input Double that defines the radius of the ray. This value is specified in centimeters. Defining a radius for a ray allows
the intersection to be within a given tolerance. This radius essentially results in the definition of a cylinder whose axis
lies along the axis defined by the RayStartPoint and RayDirection. The intersection result is between the cylinder and the
model's entities. A value higher than zero is recommended, though not explicitly required.
FoundEntities ObjectsEnumerator Output ObjectsEnumerator that returns the entities that were intersected by the ray.
LocationPoints ObjectsEnumerator
Output ObjectsEnumerator that returns a set of Point objects. One Point object is returned for each entity in the
FoundEntities list. The point defines the coordinate of the intersection between the ray and the corresponding entity.
FindFirstOnly Boolean
Optional input Boolean that specifies whether to find just the first entity in the ray's path. If False (the default) then all
entities found are returned.
This is an optional argument whose default value is False.

Syntax
SurfaceBodyProxy.IsPointInside( Point() As Double, [UseBox] As Boolean ) As ContainmentEnum
Property Value
This is a read only property whose value is a ContainmentEnum.
Parameters
Name Type Description
Point Double Point whose location to determine.
UseBox Boolean
Optional input Boolean that specifies whether to use a box to determine if the point is inside, on or outside of the body. Sometimes one
wants to avoid the creation of bounding boxes during intermediate steps of a construction because the creation of bounding boxes can be
costly. If you're applying multiple operations to a body then the bounding box of some of the shells would be invalid after each operation.
You wouldn't want to use the bounding box during these intermediate stages because you might spend more time computing the bounding
box than you'd save by using it for trivial rejection. On the other hand, if you have a stable body and a high likelihood that the bounding
box is up-to-date, then it might save some time to set the use_box parameter to true.

mass properties, due to hard coded convergence criteria in the functions. If you tighten the relative error value and the mass
properties values don't change, that means it is as close as can be achieved.

Syntax
SurfaceEvaluator.GetIsoCurve( Parameter As Double, UDirection As Boolean ) As
ObjectCollection
Parameters
Name Type Description
Parameter Double
Input Double that specifies the parameter value to indicate where the curve
should be extracted. It can be either a U or V parameter depending on the
value of the next argument.
UDirection Boolean
Input Boolean indicating if the parameter value is a U or V parameter
value. If True, then the parameter value is a V parameter indicating that the
position of the U iso curve.
Remarks
The return is an ObjectCollection that can contain one or more curves. Multiple curves are
returned in the case where the SurfaceEvaluator is obtained from a Face and the curve cuts across
internal boundaries. The resulting curve is trimmed to the boundaries and will result in multiple
curves. If the SurfaceEvaluator is obtained from a geometry object then a single curve is always
returned because there are no boundaries to trim the curve. The type of curve(s) returned is
dependent on the shape of the input curve and the surface.

Remarks
Graphic objects have two special transform behaviors: front facing and pixel scaling. A front
facing object does not rotate as the view is rotated but maintains the same orientation on the
screen. It is positioned at a specified location within model and its position on the screen will

graphic object that has pixel scaling behavior maintains the same size relative to the screen. As the
user zooms in and out the graphic objects visible size on the screen will remain the same. By
default an object has no transform behavior, which means its size, position, and orientation are
relative to model space. Text always has front facing behavior regardless of the behavior type
returned through this method.

graphic object that has pixel scaling behavior maintains the same size relative to the screen. As the
user zooms in and out the graphic objects visible size on the screen will remain the same. Any
graphic object can have no transform behavior which means it's size, position, and orientation are
relative to model space, front facing behavior, pixel scaling behavior, or front facing and pixel
scaling behavior. By default an object has not transform behavior, with the exception of text. Text
always has front facing behavior regardless of the behavior type set through this method.

Parameters
Name Type Description
SweepDefinition Object Page 4 of 15
file:///C:/Users/Cliente/AppData/Local/Temp/~hh70AC.htm 17/06/2025
SectionTwistPoints ObjectCollection
Output ObjectCollection that contains the points along the
sweep path at which the sweep twists have been specified.
The sweep path points define the positions of the sweep
cross-sections at which the twists have been specified.
Since the sweep feature is created by sweeping a profile
cross-section along a sweep path, the twist of the sweep
can theoretically be controlled at all points along the
sweep path. But for practical purposes, the creation of a
twisted sweep feature is limited to sweep features that are
swept along a spline path and the twist can only be
specified for cross-sections at fit points of the spline path.
Since the sweep feature can only be twisted at fit points of
the spline that defines the sweep path, the objects returned
in the collection will correspond to those fit points at
which the twists have been specified. The objects returned
in the collection will be either SketchPoint objects that
correspond to one of the fit points of the sweep path if it is
a 2D spline or SketchPoint3D objects that correspond to
one of the fit points of the sweep path if it is a 3D spline.
Since this argument together with the
SectionTwistVectors argument defines the twist
conditions at the cross-sections of the sweep at which the
twists have been specified, the order of the sweep path
points in the collection returned by this argument will
correspond to the order of the twist unit-vectors in the
collection returned by the SectionTwistVectors argument.
Therefore, if a particular item number in the collection
returned by this argument corresponds to a particular
sweep path point at which the sweep section has been
twisted, the same item number in the collection returned
by the SectionTwistVectors argument will correspond to
the twist vector for that sweep section. For example, if a
twist condition has been applied for the sweep crosssection
at the first fit point of the sweep path and if the
first item in the collection returned by this argument is the
first fit point of the sweep path, then the first item in the
collection returned by the SectionTwistVectors argument
will be the twist vector for the cross-section at the first fit
point of the sweep path. If no twist conditions have been
specified for any of the sweep sections, then this argument
will return Nothing.
SectionTwistVectors ObjectCollection Output ObjectCollection object that contains the unitvectors
that define the twists for the sweep sections. The
sweep twist vectors define the twists for the sweep crosssections
returned in the SectionTwistPoints argument. The
twist vectors are unit-vectors specified in the model space
coordinate system. Also, each vector lies on the plane of
the sweep cross-section for which it defines the twist. The
objects returned in the collection will be UnitVector
objects that specify the twist vector directions for the
sweep sections. Since this argument together with the
SectionTwistPoints argument defines the twist conditions
SweepDefinition Object Page 5 of 15
file:///C:/Users/Cliente/AppData/Local/Temp/~hh70AC.htm 17/06/2025
at the cross-sections of the sweep at which the twists have
been specified, the order of the twist unit-vectors in the
collection returned by this argument will correspond to
the order of the sweep path points in the collection
returned by the SectionTwistPoints argument. Therefore,
if a particular item number in the collection returned by
the SectionTwistPoints argument corresponds to a
particular sweep path point at which the sweep section has
been twisted, the same item number in the collection
returned by this argument will correspond to the twist
vector for that sweep section. For example, if a twist
condition has been applied for the sweep cross-section at
the first fit point of the sweep path and if the first item in
the collection returned by the SectionTwistPoints
argument is the first fit point of the sweep path, then the
first item in the collection returned by this argument will
be the twist vector for the cross-section at the first fit point
of the sweep path.
Remarks
This method returns the sweep path points at which section twists have been specified in the
SectionTwistPoints object collection and the corresponding twists for these sweep sections in the
SectionTwistVectors object collection. If no twist conditions have been specified for any of the
sweep sections, then both the arguments will return Nothing.

Parameters
Name Type Description
SweepDefinition Object Page 10 of 15
file:///C:/Users/Cliente/AppData/Local/Temp/~hh70AC.htm 17/06/2025
SectionTwistPoints ObjectCollection Input ObjectCollection that contains the points along the
sweep path at which the sweep twists need to be specified.
The sweep path points define the positions of the sweep
cross-sections at which the twists need to be specified.
Since the sweep feature is created by sweeping a profile
cross-section along a sweep path, the twist of the sweep
can theoretically be controlled at all points along the
sweep path. But for practical purposes, the creation of a
twisted sweep feature will be limited to sweep features
that are swept along a spline path and the twist can only
be specified for cross-sections at fit points of the spline
path. Since the sweep feature can only be twisted at fit
points of the spline that defines the sweep path, the valid
input points are only the fit points of the spline that
defines the sweep path. If any of the specified input points
are not fit points on the sweep path specified by the Path
argument, then setting the twists for the sweep sections
will fail. Therefore, the valid input objects can be either
SketchPoint objects that correspond to any of the fit points
of the sweep path if it is a 2D spline or SketchPoint3D
objects that correspond to any of the fit points of the
sweep path if it is a 3D spline. Since this argument
together with the SectionTwistVectors argument defines
the twist conditions at all cross-sections of the sweep at
which the twist needs to be specified, valid collection
objects need to be specified for both these arguments in
order to define twist conditions for the sweep. Also, the
following conditions need to be satisfied in order to
correctly specify both these arguments:
• The number of items in the collection specified by
this argument must be the same as the number of
items in the collection specified by the
SectionTwistVectors argument.
• The order of the sweep path points in the collection
specified by this argument must correspond to the
order of the twist unit-vectors in the collection
specified by the SectionTwistVectors argument.
Therefore, if a particular item number in the collection
specified by this argument corresponds to a particular
SweepDefinition Object Page 11 of 15
file:///C:/Users/Cliente/AppData/Local/Temp/~hh70AC.htm 17/06/2025
sweep path point at which the sweep section needs to be
twisted, the same item number in the collection specified
by the SectionTwistVectors argument should correspond
to the twist vector for that sweep section. For example, for
a twist condition that needs to be applied for the sweep
cross-section at the first fit point of the sweep path, if the
first item in the collection specified by this argument is
the first fit point of the sweep path, then the first item in
the collection specified by the SectionTwistVectors
argument must be the twist vector for the cross-section at
the first fit point of the sweep path. Setting the twists for
the sweep sections will fail for the following cases:
• The object collections specified for this argument
and the SectionTwistVectors arguments are both
empty.
• Valid object collections are specified for both this
argument and the SectionTwistVectors argument,
but any of the sweep path points specified by this
argument are not fit points on the sweep path
specified by the Path argument.
SectionTwistVectors ObjectCollection Input ObjectCollection object that specifies the unitvectors
that define the twists for the sweep sections. The
sweep twist vectors define the twists for the sweep crosssections
specified using the SectionTwistPoints argument.
The twist vectors are unit-vectors specified in the model
space coordinate system. Also, each vector should lie on
the plane of the sweep cross-section for which it defines
the twist, otherwise, setting the twists for the sweep
sections will fail. Therefore, the valid input objects are
UnitVector objects that specify the twist vector directions
for the sweep sections. Since this argument together with
the SectionTwistPoints argument defines the twist
conditions at all cross-sections of the sweep at which the
twist needs to be specified, valid collection objects need
to be specified for both these arguments in order to define
twist conditions for the sweep. Also, the following
conditions need to be satisfied in order to correctly specify
both these arguments:
• The number of items in the collection specified by
this argument must be the same as the number of
SweepDefinition Object Page 12 of 15
file:///C:/Users/Cliente/AppData/Local/Temp/~hh70AC.htm 17/06/2025
items in the collection specified by the
SectionTwistPoints argument.
• The order of the sweep path points in the collection
specified by the SectionTwistPoints argument must
correspond to the order of the twist unit-vectors in
the collection specified by this argument.
Therefore, if a particular item number in the collection
specified by the SectionTwistPoints argument corresponds
to a particular sweep path point at which the sweep
section needs to be twisted, the same item number in the
collection specified by this argument should correspond to
the twist vector for that sweep section.
For example, for a twist condition that needs to be applied
for the sweep cross-section at the first fit point of the
sweep path, if the first item in the collection specified by
the SectionTwistPoints argument is the first fit point of
the sweep path, then the first item in the collection
specified by this argument must be the twist vector for the
cross-section at the first fit point of the sweep path.
Setting the twists for the sweep sections will fail for the
following cases: The object collections specified for this
argument and the SectionTwistPoints arguments are both
empty.
Valid object collections are specified for both this
argument and the SectionTwistPoints argument, but any
of the twist unit-vectors specified by this argument does
not lie on the respective sweep cross-section plane for
which the unit-vector defines the twist.
Remarks
The SectionTwistPoints argument specifies the object collection that contains the sweep path
points at which section twists need to be applied and the SectionTwistPoints argument specifies
the object collection that contains the corresponding twist vectors for these sweep sections.
