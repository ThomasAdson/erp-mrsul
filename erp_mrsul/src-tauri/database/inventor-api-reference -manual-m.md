FormattedText String Input String that specifies the text of the
note. This string can contain tags that
define internal formatting changes, which
override the text style associated with the
general note. The formatting is specified
using XML tags within the string. By
default, all text in the string will be
displayed using the text style assigned to
the note. You can use the XML tags to
override the default style and apply style
overrides for all or portions of the text.
The formatting overrides are defined
using tags. There is an opening tag and
closing tag for each formatting override
you define. The text between the opening
and closing tags is affected by the
override. See the list of XML text
formatting tags under Reference Topics in
the Overviews section.

joint
This sample demonstrates creating an assembly joint. It connects the midpoints of the
edges of two faces using a rotational joint. To do this it first creates a geometry intent
object of the midpoint of the edge and then creates another intent using the face and
the midpoint intent. It does this to create to midpoint intents which it then uses to
create the rotational connection.

The sample uses and existing part that must be set up to allow it to work correctly. To
create the sample part you can use any part that has a planar face and a linear edge
connected to that planar face. A simple box is sufficient. In this part Add a mate iMate
to the planar face and rename the iMate to "Face1". Also add a mate iMate to a linear
edge that is on the face previously named and rename this iMate to "Edge1". Save the
part to "C:\Temp\SamplePart.ipt" or any other name and edit the code below to
reference the file. You can then run the sample code which will create a new
assembly, insert two instances of the part and create a rotational connection between
them. Then it will animation the rotation by driving the connection.

This sample demonstrates how to demote a top level occurrence in an assembly
into a new sub-assembly occurrence.
SurfaceBody
Copy
This sample demonstrates copying a surface body from one part to another.
This is equivalent to the Promote command, but the API is much more flexible.
In order for the sample to be self-contained, it creates two parts on the fly that
will be used to demonstrate copying a body from one part to another. When
copying a body into a part, you provide the surface body and a matrix to define
its position in the new part. This sample creates a matrix based on the position
of these parts within an assembly.
Derived Parts

This sample demonstrates the use of the API to create derived parts and
assemblies.
Client Graphics
- Line
This sample demonstrates the creation of custom graphics using LineGraphics
and LineStripGraphics. The same set of coordinate data is used for both types
of graphics. Line graphics use two coordinates to define a line, and then the
next two coordinates to define the next line, and so on through the defined
coordinates. For the data provided, this results in gaps in the drawn curve. Line
strips use the first two coordinates to define the first line and then the last point
of the first line becomes the first point of the second line and the next
coordinate is used as the end point of the second line. This results in the set of
points being connected by a continuous set of lines, drawing a continuous
curve. This sample also demonstrates two methods of defining the color for
client graphics. In one case it uses an existing appearance asset, and in the
other, it explicitly defines a color and assigns it. To use the sample you need to
have an assembly or part document open. The program has two behaviors: the
first time it is run it will draw the graphics. The second time it is run it deletes
the previously drawn graphics.

text. This method only returns the geometry which is shown in black below. You can get the textual information
separately in one of two ways, as a description of the text or as graphics that represent the display of the text. As
a description of the text you can use properties on the various annotations to determine the text that’s
displayed. For the raw text graphics, use the GetDisplayText method.
For the above example, Below are each of the arguments and the values returned along with a brief description
of the value.
GroupCount = 4, In this example each character or symbol is a group, but this shouldn’t be expected in all
cases. For example a group defines a filled area and voids within that area. A character that has disjoint filled
areas like a percent sign % will be returned as three groups since there are three filled areas. Unfilled shapes can
be returned as a group of multiple polylines or several groups each containing a single polyline. The geometry
described is the same and no expectation should be made about how it’s presented.

PolylinesPerGroup
(0) = 2
(1) = 3
(2) = 1
(3) = 3
The number of polylines within each group is specified with this argument, where a polyline is equivalent to a
loop.
FilledGroups
(0) = True, The “A” is filled
(1) = True, The “B” is filled
(2) = True, The “C” is filled
(3) = False, the center symbol is not filled
PolylineCount
The polyline count is 9 in this case. This is the total number of polylines. This can also be computed by adding
up the values returned by the PolylinesPerGroup argument.
PolylineLengths
(0) = 9, The outer shape of the “A”
(1) = 4, The inner shape of the “A”
(2) = Many points because of the curved areas of the “B”
(3) = Many points because of the curved areas of the “B”
(4) = Many points because of the curved areas of the “B”
(5) = Many points because of the curved areas of the “C”
(6) = Many points because of the circle in the center symbol.
(7) = 2, One of the lines of the center symbol.
(8) = 2, The other line of the center symbol.

VertexCount
The VertexCount is many and cannot be pre-determined because curves and arcs are stroked into line segments.
VertexCoordinates
The number vertex coordinates is VertexCount * 3, These are the x,y,z coordintes of the vertices in model
space.
Here’s another simpler example without any curves.
GroupCount
The GroupCount is 4 because each box is a logical group.
PolylinesPerGroup
(0) = 1
(1) = 1
(2) = 2
(3) = 3
The number of polylines within each group is specified with this argument, where a polyline is equivalent to a
loop.
FilledGroups
(0) = True, The first shape is filled
(1) = False, The second shape is not filled
(2) = False, The third shape is not filled
(3) = True, the fourth shape is filled
PolylineCount
The polyline count is 7 and is the total number of polylines in all groups.
ModelAnnotation Object Page 6 of 13
file:///C:/Users/Cliente/AppData/Local/Temp/~hh2095.htm 16/06/2025
PolylineLengths
(0) = 4, The number of segments in the first shape.
(1) = 4, The number of segments in the second shape.
(2) = 4, The number of segments in the outer loop of the third shape.
(3) = 4, The number of segments in the inner loop of the third shape.
(4) = 4, The number of segments in the outer loop of the fourth shape.
(5) = 4, The number of segments in the first inner loop of the fourth shape.
(6) = 4, The number of segments in the second inner loop of the fourth shape.
VertexCount
The vertex count is 35. There are 7 rectangles in the image above. Each polyline is represented by 5 points since
the first and last coordinate is repeated for a closed shape. This results in 35 vertices.
VertexCoordinates
(0) = 0.0, x coordinate of the 1st vertex of shape 1
(1) = 0.0, y coordinate of the 1st vertex of shape 1
(2) = 0.0, z coordinate of the 1st vertex of shape 1

Parameters
Name Type Description
Camera Camera
Input Camera object that specifies the view orientation. This can either be a transient Camera object or
that got from View object etc.. And the camera properties can be changed but not applied.
GroupCount Long
Output Long that indicates the number of groups. A group is a set of related polylines where there can be
one outer and multiple inner polylines. Groups can optionally also be filled.
PolylinesPerGroup Long
Output array of Longs that indicates the number of polylines in each of the groups. The array size will be
GroupCount where each value of this array indicates the number of polylines within each group.
When reading the polylines within a group, the first polyline is the outer polyline and any additional
closed polylines represent internal voids if the group is filled.
FilledGroups Boolean
Output array of Booleans that indicates which groups are filled. A value of True indicates the
corresponding group is filled. The array size will be GroupCount. If a group is filled, the first polyline in
the group defines the outer loop. Any other polylines for that group represent internal loops and voids in

Parameters
Name Type Description
FormattedText String
Input String that specifies the text of the note. This string can contain tags that define internal formatting
changes, which override the text style associated with the general note. The formatting is specified using XML
tags within the string. By default, all text in the string will be displayed using the text style assigned to the note.
You can use the XML tags to override the default style and apply style overrides for all or portions of the text.
The formatting overrides are defined using tags. There is an opening tag and closing tag for each formatting
override you define. The text between the opening and closing tags is affected by the override. See the list of
XML text formatting tags under Reference Topics in the Overviews section.
OnScreen Boolean Input Boolean value that specifies whether the general note is on screen or not.
ScreenQuadrant Variant
Optional input ScreenQuadrantEnum value that specifies the location of the general note on screen. This is
ignored if the OnScreen is specified as False. This defaults to kLowerLeftQuadrant if not specified.
This is an optional argument whose default value is null.
AnnotationPlaneDefinition Variant Optional input AnnotationPlaneDefinition object that defines the annotation plane the general note will be
created on. An existing annotation plane can be specified by using the AnnotationPlaneDefinition object
associated with the existing annotation plane. If the OnScreen is specified as True then this argument is ignored,
otherwise this is required.

file:///C:/Users/Cliente/AppData/Local/Temp/~hhBD4F.htm 16/06/2025
this argument is kBefore. Inventor is not in a state to correctly
handle edit operations after that point.
Context NameValueMap
Input NameValueMap object that can be used to determine the
context of why the event fired. No context information is
provided for this event.
HandlingCode HandlingCodeEnum
Output HandlingCodeEnum that indicates how you are handling
the event. The value of this argument is currently ignored for
this event.
Remarks
Currently the notification is limited to features and parameters. Notification for parameters is only sent
when a parameter is explicitly deleted, not when it is deleted as a result of its owner being deleted. For
example if you delete a fillet feature, the notification will be sent for the fillet feature, but not for the
parameter that controls the fillet radius, even though the parameter is deleted as a result of the feature
delete. The type of entities supported for this event may be expanded in the future so you should be
careful to write code that is not dependent on the current behavior and filters correctly for the entity
type you need.

Output HandlingCodeEnum that indicates how you are handling
the event. The value of this argument is currently ignored for
this event.
Remarks
This is provided for features in parts and also for assembly features. A change is defined as the
modification of a feature's definition. This can occur when the end-user uses the edit command for that
particular feature and when a feature is modified using the API. A feature recomputing as the result of
other changes in the model is not considered a feature change. For example, if a fillet recomputes
because the underlying geometry has changed, this is not considered a feature change because only the
resulting geometry changed, not the definition of the fillet. Also, editing any of the various objects the
feature is dependent on (sketch, parameters) is also not considered a feature change.

Parameters
Name Type Description
DocumentObject Document The Document object the parameter is contained within.
Parameter Parameter The Parameter object that is being changed.
BeforeOrAfter EventTimingEnum
Input EventTimingEnum indicating when the event is being
fired. Notification is sent before and after the value of the
parameter is changed. Using the kBefore timing you can
examine the parameter to determine its state before the change
is applied and then compare it to the state when the timing is
kAfter.
Context NameValueMap
Input NameValueMap object that can be used to determine the
context of why the event fired. When BeforeOrAfter is kBefore
one of the following values is provided depending on what
information associated with the parameter is changing:
• Name = "Value". Value = A String containing the new
value of the parameter. This is provided if the value of the
parameter is changed. This is the equivalent of the Value
property of the parameter converted to a String, so it is in
internal units.
• Name = "Unit". Value = The String containing the new
units of the parameter. This indicates that the unit of the
parameter has been changed.
• Name = "Name". Value = A String containing the new
name of the parameter. This is provided if the name of the
parameter is changed.
HandlingCode HandlingCodeEnum
Output HandlingCodeEnum that indicates how you are handling
the event. The value of this argument is currently ignored for
this event.
Remarks
A parameter's value can be changed in many ways. This notification is sent for any change, regardless
of what caused it. For example some ways that a parameter value can change are:
ModelingEvents Object Page 9 of 11
file:///C:/Users/Cliente/AppData/Local/Temp/~hhBD4F.htm 16/06/2025
• An explicit edit by the end-user by editing the value in the Parameters dialog or editing the value
of the associated dimension.
• Being driven through an adaptive assembly. For example, if the length of a part changes as other
parts in an assembly are modified, a notification is sent when the parameter controlling the length
is changed as a result of the adaptivity.
• Being changed as the result of an equation. For example, if there is a parameter A whose equation
is "1.0" and parameter B whose equation is "A * 2", any change to A will also cause B to change.
In this case a notification will be sent for A and also for B since both of them will have changed.
