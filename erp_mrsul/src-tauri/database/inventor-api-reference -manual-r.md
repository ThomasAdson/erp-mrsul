RadialMarkingMenu Object
Description
The RadialMarkingMenu object provides access to the contents of the radial marking menu
(displayed when the user right clicks).
Methods
Name Description
Clear
Method that clears the all of the controls for this radial marking menu.
This is equivalent to assigning Nothing to each control. When no controls
are defined, the radial marking menu is not displayed.
CreateRadialSubMenu
Method that creates a transient RadialMarkingMenu. This object can then
be assigned to any of the radial menu controls to create a sub-menu.
Controls within the sub-menu can be left un-assigned to indicate the
absence of those controls.
Delete
Method that deletes this radial marking menu. Standard Inventor radial
marking menus cannot be deleted, so this method is only valid for radial
marking menus where the BuiltIn property returns False.

string is input it can be any string that can be
evaluated by Inventor to result in a unitless
number.
XSpacing Variant
Input Variant that defines the spacing between
instances in the X direction. This can be either a
numeric value or a string. A parameter will be
created to control this value when the feature is
created. If a string is input it can be any string that
can be evaluated by Inventor to result in a unitless
number. This input may be left unspecified only if
the XSpacingType is kFitToPathLength and if the
XDirectionEntity is not a work axis.
XSpacingType PatternSpacingTypeEnum
Optional input PatternSpacingTypeEnum enum
that indicates if the occurrences along the x
direction are to be fitted within a specified
distance. A value of kDefault indicates that the
occurrences are to be separated by the specified
distance. A value of kFitted indicates that all
occurrences are to be fitted within the specified
distance. A value of kFitToPathLength indicates
that all occurrences are to be fitted within a
distance equal to the length of the
XDirectionEntity. The kFitToPathLength value is
invalid in cases where the XDirectionEntity is a
work axis.

RibDefinition Object
Description
RibDefinition Object.
Methods
Name Description
Copy
Method that creates a copy of this RibDefinition object. The new
RibDefinition object is independent of any feature. It can be edited and used
as input to edit an existing feature or to create a new Rib feature.
One typical use of this method is when you need to make several changes to
an existing Rib feature. If you edit the RibDefinition object associated with
the Rib feature, the feature will recompute after each edit. It’s more efficient
to make a copy, edit the copy, and then assign the copy to the feature. This
will result in a single recompute.
The RibFeatures.CreateDefinition method can also be used to create an
independent RibDefinition object. The difference is that one created with the
Copy method will have the same initial values as the object is was copied
from. One that’s created with the CreateDefinition method will be initialized
to predefined default values.
GetThicknessPlane Method that gets the plane at which the input thickness is held.
SetFiniteExtent Method that sets the extent type to be a finite distance.
SetThicknessPlane Method that sets the plane at which the input thickness is held.
SetToNextExtent
Method that sets the extent type to be ‘to next’ (i.e. it terminates on the next
face).
Properties
Name Description
AffectedBody
Read-write property that gets and sets the solid body affected by the creation
of this rib feature. For parts containing multiple solid bodies, this property
defaults to the primary solid body of the part, and can be set to any of the
other solid bodies.
Application
Returns the top-level parent application object. When used the context of
Inventor, an Application object is returned. When used in the context of
Apprentice, an ApprenticeServer object is returned.
BossSets
Read-only property that returns the BossSets collection object containing
boss definitions of the rib feature.
DirectionReversed Read-write property that gets and sets whether the direction of the profile
projection should be reversed. If the profile is projected normal to the sketch

DraftProfileEnds Read-write property that gets and sets the draft profile ends value.
ExtendProfile
Read-write property that gets and sets whether the rib profile should be
extended/trimmed to intersect faces, if necessary. This property defaults to
True for a newly created RibDefinition object.
ExtentDistance
Read-only property that returns the parameter that corresponds to the
distance value for rib feature defined with a finite extent. This property
returns a parameter only if the ExtentType is kFiniteRibExtent, else this
property returns Nothing. Also, in the case where this is a newly created
RibDefinition object or it has been copied from an existing RibDefinition
object, this property returns Nothing since there isn’t a parameter created yet.
ExtentType
Read-only property that returns the extent type of the rib feature. The
possible return values are kFiniteRibExtent and kToNextRibExtent. When
the RibDefinition object is initially created, this defaults to
kToNextRibExtent. If this property returns kFiniteRibExtent, the
ExtentDistance property returns the correspond parameter. Use the
SetFiniteExtent and Set ToNextExtent methods to edit the extent type.
IsRib
Read-write property that gets and sets whether the sketch profile is projected
lateral to the sketch plane (rib) or normal to the sketch plane (web) to create
the feature. A value of True indicates that the profile is projected lateral to
the sketch plane.
Parent
Read-only property that returns the parent RibFeature of this RibDefinition
object. In the case where this is a newly created RibDefinition object or it has
been copied from an existing RibDefinition object, this property will return
Nothing because there is not a logical parent for the object.
ProfileCurves
Read-write property that gets and sets the collection of sketch entities used as
the profile for feature creation.
Thickness
Read-write property that provides access to the thickness of the feature. This
property is writable when the RibDefinition object has been created using the
RibFeatures.CreateDefinition or RibDefinition.Copy methods. The value can
be set using either a doubl.
ThicknessDirection
Read-write property that gets and sets the side of the profile on which to
apply the thickness. This property defaults to kSymmetricExtentDirection for
a newly created RibDefinition object.
Type Returns an ObjectTypeEnum indicating this object's type.

EntityOne Object
Input object that defines the first object. This object can be a planar face, work plane,
linear edge, work axis, or a face that defines an axis.
EntityTwo Object
Input object that defines the second object. This object can be a planar face, work
plane, linear edge, work axis, or a face that defines an axis.
Angle Variant
Input Variant that defines the angle between the two input entities. This can be either
a numeric value or a string. A parameter for this value is created and the supplied
string or value is assigned to the parameter. If a value is input, the units are radians.
If a string is input the units can be specified as part of the string or will default to the
current angle units of the document.
SolutionType AngleConstraintSolutionTypeEnum
Optional input AngleConstraintSolutionTypeEnum that specifies the solution type. If
specified to be kDirectedSolution, the solution always applies the right hand rule. If
specified to be kUndirectedSolution, the solution allows either orientation, thus
resolving situations where component orientation flips during a constraint drive or
drag. If specified to be kReferenceVectorSolution, the ReferenceVectorEntity
argument must be provided with a third entity for the solution. The default value is
kDirectedSolution.
This is an optional argument whose default value is 78593.

As AngleConstraintSolutionTypeEnum, [ReferenceVectorEntity] As Variant, [BiasPointOne] As Variant, [BiasPointTwo] As Variant ) As
AngleConstraint
Parameters
Name Type Description
EntityOne Object
Input object that defines the first object. This object can be a planar face, work
plane, linear edge, work axis, or a face that defines an axis.
EntityTwo Object
Input object that defines the second object. This object can be a planar face,
work plane, linear edge, work axis, or a face that defines an axis.
Angle Variant
Input Variant that defines the angle between the two input entities. This can be
either a numeric value or a string. A parameter for this value is created and the
supplied string or value is assigned to the parameter. If a value is input, the
units are radians. If a string is input the units can be specified as part of the
string or will default to the current angle units of the document.
SolutionType AngleConstraintSolutionTypeEnum
Optional input AngleConstraintSolutionTypeEnum that specifies the solution
type. If specified to be kDirectedSolution, the solution always applies the right
hand rule. If specified to be kUndirectedSolution, the solution allows either
orientation, thus resolving situations where component orientation flips during
a constraint drive or drag. If specified to be kReferenceVectorSolution, the
ReferenceVectorEntity argument must be provided with a third entity for the
solution. The default value is kDirectedSolution.
This is an optional argument whose default value is 78593.
ReferenceVectorEntity Variant
Optional input object that provides a third entity to solve the angle constraint.
This argument is ignored if the SolutionType argument is not
kReferenceVectorSolution. This object can be a planar face, work plane, linear
edge, work axis, or a face that defines an axis.
This is an optional argument whose default value is null.
BiasPointOne Variant
Optional input Point object that is used help in determining the initial position
of the occurrence. The occurrences are repositioned in an attempt to make the
two bias points coincident. This provides some general control over the
position of the occurrence when it isn't being controlled by another constraint.
An example of when the bias points are useful is the case when the first
constraint on a part is a mate constraint. In the case where the mate is between
two planes, the parts can be positioned anywhere along the infinite plane that
defines their mating contact. Using the bias points you can define the position
of the two occurrences, relative to each other. If a bias point is not given, one
is calculated that is at the center of the parameter range of the input entity.
This is an optional argument whose default value is null.

Optional input Point object that is used help in determining the initial position of the occurrence. The occurrences
are repositioned in an attempt to make the two bias points coincident. This provides some general control over the
position of the occurrence when it isn't being controlled by another constraint.
An example of when the bias points are useful is the case when the first constraint on a part is a mate constraint. In
the case where the mate is between two planes, the parts can be positioned anywhere along the infinite plane that
defines their mating contact. Using the bias points you can define the position of the two occurrences, relative to
each other.
If a bias point is not given, one is calculated that is at the center of the parameter range of the input entity.
This is an optional argument whose default value is null.

Parameters
Name Type Description
FaceOne Face
First input face that defines the initial face that is used in repositioning the parts. Once the constraint is placed it can
move along any of the faces of the part.
FaceTwo Face
Second input face that defines the initial face that is used in repositioning the parts. Once the constraint is placed it
can move along any of the faces of the part.
BiasPointOne Variant
Optional input Point object that is used help in determining the initial position of the occurrence. The occurrences
are repositioned in an attempt to make the two bias points coincident. This provides some general control over the

An example of when the bias points are useful is the case when the first constraint on a part is a mate constraint. In
the case where the mate is between two planes, the parts can be positioned anywhere along the infinite plane that
defines their mating contact. Using the bias points you can define the position of the two occurrences, relative to
each other.
If a bias point is not given, one is calculated that is at the center of the parameter range of the input entity.
This is an optional argument whose default value is null.
