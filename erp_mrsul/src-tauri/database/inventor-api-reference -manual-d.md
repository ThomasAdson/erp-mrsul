DecalFeatures.Add Method
Parent Object: DecalFeatures
DecalFeatures Object Page 1 of 5
file:///C:/Users/Cliente/AppData/Local/Temp/~hhCFF.htm 16/06/2025
Description
Method that creates a new decal feature by applying an image on one or more faces in the model.
Syntax
DecalFeatures.Add( Image As SketchImage, Face As Face, [WrapFace] As Boolean,
[ChainFaces] As Boolean ) As DecalFeature
Parameters
Name Type Description
Image SketchImage
Input SketchImage object used to define the sketch image used to apply
the decal.
Face Face
Input Face object that defines the primary face on which the decal
should be applied. The orientation of the face must be such that the
image can be projected onto the face, otherwise the creation of the
decal will fail. If the face is planar, then the angle between the normal
vector of the face and the normal vector of the sketch plane that
contains the image should be less than 90 degrees. If this angle is equal
to 90 degrees (which means that the plane of the face is perpendicular
to the plane of the image) or if this angle is greater than 90 degrees,
then the creation of the decal will fail. For example, if the face is planar
and the plane of the face is perpendicular to the plane of the image,
then the creation of the decal will fail.
WrapFace Boolean
Optional Input Boolean that specifies if the image should be wrapped
on the face on which the decal needs to be applied. If a value of True is
specified, then the image will be wrapped on the face on which the
decal is applied. But, the image will be wrapped on the face only if the
face is tangential to the plane of the image. If the face is not tangential
to the plane of the image and a value of True is specified for this
argument, then the creation of the decal will fail. The effects of
wrapping the decal are pronounced if the face is a curved face. If a
value of False is specified, then it implies that the decal feature should
not be wrapped around the face, but created as a result of straight
projection onto the face. A default value of False will be assumed if no
value is explicitly specified for this argument.
This is an optional argument whose default value is False.
ChainFaces Boolean
Optional Input Boolean that specifies whether the decal should also be
applied on any faces that are adjacent to the primary face on which the
decal needs to be applied. If a value of True is specified, then the decal
will also be applied on adjacent faces in addition to the primary face
specified by the Face argument. If there are no adjacent faces, then the
decal will be applied only on the primary face. If a value of False is
specified, then the decal will be applied only on the primary face
specified by the Face argument. A default value of True will be
assumed if no value is explicitly specified for this argument.
This is an optional argument whose default value is True.

InclusionOption
Read-write property that defines if this occurrence is included and if it is how it is used in the
derived assembly. Valid values for this property are kDerivedIncludeAll, kDerivedExcludeAll
and kDerivedIndividualDefined. If this occurrence represents a subassembly, setting to
kDerivedIncludeAll will cause all sub occurrences to add material to the solid body. If setting
to kDerivedIndividualDefined, the sub occurrence’s define their behavior. An important
distinction between “All” and “IndividualDefined” switches is that as occurrences are added
to the subassembly they will automatically be included if any of the “All” switches are used. If
the “InidividualDefined” switch is used, new components added to the assembly will be set to
kDerivedExludeAll. If this occurrence represents a leaf part, then valid options are
kDerivedIncludeAll or kDerivedExcludeAll.
IsAssembly
Read-only property that specifies whether this DerivedFutureAssemblyOccurrence object
represents a subassembly or a leaf part. This property is True in the case where it represents a

For information on this object, please refer to DrawingView, which provides identical or very similar functionality.
Methods
Name Description
Align
Method that aligns this view with the input drawing view. The method returns a
failure if the view is already aligned. Use the Aligned property to check for this
condition and to break existing alignment.
AlignAuxiliary
Method that re-aligns an auxiliary view. The method fails if the view is not an
auxiliary view.
CopyTo
Method that copies this drawing view into the specified sheet. The new object is
returned.
CreateOriginIndicator
Method that creates the origin indicator for ordinate dimensions and hole tables. The
specified input GeometryIntent object must be associated with this drawing view,
otherwise this method will fail.
Delete Method that deletes the DrawingView.
DrawingViewToModelSpace
Method that takes a 2d coordinate in drawing view space, and returns a Line in model
space. Since this method transforms from 2D space to 3D space, there is insufficient
information to obtain a 3D model point. Hence, this method returns a Line in the view
direction on which the point lies. You may then use the FindUsingRay method to find
the point(s) of interest.
DrawingViewToSheetSpace
Method that takes a 2d coordinate in drawing view space, and returns a Point2d
containing the coordinates of the point in sheet space.
GetAutomatedCenterlineSettings
Method that returns the settings that define how automatic center lines and center
marks are to be calculated for this view.
GetHiddenLinesStatus Method that gets the hidden lines status of a component in the drawing view.

GetReferenceKey Method that generates and returns the reference key for this entity.
GetVisibility Method that gets the visibility of the input object in the drawing view.
GetWeldmentState
Method that gets the weldment option for the drawing view. The method returns a
failure if the referenced model does not contain weldments.
InsertInModelSpace
Inserts the view geometry into model space only if the drawing lives in an Inventor
DWG file.
ModelToDrawingViewSpace
Method that takes a 3d coordinate in model space, and returns a Point2d object
containing the coordinate point in drawing view space.
ModelToSheetSpace
Method that takes a 3d coordinate in model space, and returns a Point2d object
containing the coordinate point in sheet space.
MoveTo
Method that moves this drawing view into the specified sheet. The moved object is
returned.
RotateByAngle Method that rotates the drawing view by the specified angle.
SetActiveModelState
Method that sets the active model state for a drawing view. In this method users can
also decide to update the PartsList objects which use the same model state as the
drawing view. This method fails for drawing views where the model is unresolved.
SetAutomatedCenterlineSettings
Method that sets the automatic centerline and center mark settings for this view and
creates the centerlines and center marks defined by the settings. The centerlines and
center marks that were created are returned.
SetDesignViewRepresentation
Method that sets a design view representation for a drawing view of an assembly.
This method fails for drawing views of parts and presentations and in the case where
the model (assembly) is unresolved.
SetHiddenLinesStatus Method that sets the hidden lines status of a component in the drawing view.

file:///C:/Users/Cliente/AppData/Local/Temp/~hh930F.htm 16/06/2025
SetIncludeStatus Method that sets the include status of the input object in the drawing view. This
method automatically makes the object visible as well. After an object has been
included, its visibility can be controlled using the GetVisibility and SetVisibility
methods.
SetVisibility Method that sets the visibility of the input object in the drawing view.
SetWeldmentState
Method that sets the weldment option for the drawing view. The method returns a
failure if the referenced model does not contain weldments.
SheetToDrawingViewSpace
Method that takes a 2d coordinate in sheet space, and returns a Point2d object
containing the coordinate point in drawing view space.
SheetToModelSpace
Method that takes a 2d coordinate in sheet space, and returns a Line in model space.
Since this method transforms from 2D space to 3D space, there is insufficient
information to obtain a 3D model point. Hence, this method returns a Line in the view
direction on which the point lies. You may then use the FindUsingRay method to find
the point(s) of interest.
ShowHiddenAnnotations Method that displays all the annotations hidden by the user.
ShowHiddenCurves Method that displays all the curves explicitly hidden by the user.

Parameters
Name Type Description
Line SketchLine Input SketchLine object.
Entity SketchEntity
Input sketch entity. This must be either a or SketchPoint object. If
creating a linear diameter dimension and Entity is a SketchLine,
then Entity is used as the centerline. If Entity is a SketchPoint, then
Line is used as the centerline.
TextPoint Point2d Input object that defines the position of the dimension text.
LinearDiameter Boolean
Input Boolean that specifies whether the dimension should be a
standard distance dimension or be displayed as a linear diameter
dimension.
Driven Boolean
DimensionConstraints Object Page 5 of 17
file:///C:/Users/Cliente/AppData/Local/Temp/~hhD8C5.htm 16/06/2025
Optional input Boolean that specifies whether the dimension should
be a driven or driving dimension. The default is False, which will
create a driving dimension.
This is an optional argument whose default value is False.
Remarks
One of the input entities must be a sketch line. The other entity can be either a line or a point.
When two lines are input this constraint has the effect of forcing parallelism between the lines.
The dimension axis is perpendicular to the sketch line input for the Line argument. The picture
below illustrates two cases of the offset dimension constraint. In the dimension with the 0.614
value, the two red vertical lines are constrained. In the second case the line representing the center
line and the horizontal red line are constrained. In the second case the LinearDiameter flag was set
to True to result in the linear diameter type of dimension.
In the picture below, two offset dimension constraints are placed. This illustrates that the input
line controls the axis of the dimension. The dimension line is perpendicular to the sketch line. The
distance between the line and the other object is controlled by the constraint. The two dimensions
below are both between a line and a point. The 0.684 dia. was placed with the LinearDiameter flag
set to true.

Parameters
Name Type Description
EntityOne SketchEntity
Input , SketchArc, or SketchLine object. Both EntityOne and
EntityTwo cannot be sketch lines, at least one must be an arc or
circle.
EntityTwo SketchEntity
Input , SketchArc, or SketchLine object. Both EntityOne and
EntityTwo cannot be sketch lines, at least one must be an arc or
circle.
ProximityPointOne Point2d
The supplied by this argument is used when EntityOne is a
circle or arc. This point specifies which of the possible two
tangent cases is used when creating the constraint. The closest
tangent to the input point is used. If EntityOne is a line, this
argument is ignored.
ProximityPointTwo Point2d
The supplied by this argument is used when EntityTwo is a
circle or arc. This point specifies which of the possible two
tangent cases is used when creating the constraint. The closest
tangent to the input point is used. If EntityTwo is a line, this
argument is ignored.
TextPoint Point2d Input object that defines the position of the dimension text.
LinearDiameter Boolean

False, which causes a driving dimension constraint to be
created.
This is an optional argument whose default value is False.
Remarks
The proximity point arguments are required whenever a circle or arc is input. This point specifies
which of the two possible solutions is used when creating the constraint. The figure below
illustrates two tangent distance constraints placed using the same input arguments except the
proximity point for the smaller circle indicated the position closer to the large circle in one case
and further away in the other.

The General Dimension command allows you to dimension the difference in radius between two
concentric circles. During interactive placement there is special behavior that makes the placement
behave similar to that when placing a radius or diameter dimension. However, the command
actually creates a TangentDistanceDimConstraint. By providing the appropriate input you can
duplicate the result using the AddTangentDistance method. The result is shown below.
The picture below illustrates creating a tangent dimension constraint between a line and an arc.
The 1.293 dia. dimension was placed by inputting the red line representing the center line and the
red arc. It is defined to be a linear diameter style of dimension.

Remarks
The position of the text point defines which of the four quadrants the constraint is placed within.
The picture below illustrates the result of adding a three-point angle dimension constraint.
The General Dimension command allows you to place a dimension controlling the sweep angle of
an arc by selecting the arc and the center point. This results in a three point angle dimension
constraint being placed between the two sketch points at the end of the arc and the sketch point at
the center. This results in a dimension like that shown below.

Syntax
DimensionConstraints3D.AddLineLength( Line As SketchLine3D, [TextPoint] As Variant, [Driven] As
Boolean ) As LineLengthDimConstraint3D
Parameters
Name Type Description
Line SketchLine3D Object that defines the 3D sketch line being constrained.
TextPoint Variant
Object that defines the position of the dimension text. The dimension text will always
be placed on a particular dimension plane the orientation of which will be
automatically determined using the input line that is being dimensioned. The
dimension plane is a transient geometric plane which is only used to define the
placement plane for the dimension text and does not have a graphical representation. If
no input is specified for the position of the dimension text, a default position on the
dimension plane will be calculated and used to place the dimension text. If a valid
point for the dimension text is specified, then either of the following conditions will
apply: * If the specified point already lies on the dimension plane, then this point will
be directly used to place the dimension text. * If the specified point does not lie on the
dimension plane, it will be projected onto the dimension plane. Therefore, the resultant
placement position for the dimension text will be different from the specified one. The
GetDimensionPlane method of the DimensionConstraints3D object can be used to get
the dimension plane object which provides access to the dimension plane geometry.
This is an optional argument whose default value is null.
Driven Boolean
Specifies whether the dimension should be a driven or driving dimension. The default
value is False, which causes a driving dimension constraint to be created.
This is an optional argument whose default value is False.

file:///C:/Users/Cliente/AppData/Local/Temp/~hhF7A7.htm 16/06/2025
Method that creates a new linear dimension constraint between a 3D sketch point and a planar face or workplane.
This method will fail if the input 3D sketch point lies on the input plane specified by the face or workplane. This
method will also fail in the case where a driving dimension is specified and it will overconstrain the sketch.
Syntax
DimensionConstraints3D.AddPointAndPlaneDistance( Point As SketchPoint3D, Plane As Object, [TextPoint]
As Variant, [Driven] As Boolean ) As PointAndPlaneDistanceDimConstraint3D
Parameters
Name Type Description
Point SketchPoint3D Object that defines the 3D sketch point being constrained.
Plane Object
Planar Face or WorkPlane object that defines the distance to the 3D sketch point being
constrained.
TextPoint Variant
Point object that defines the position of the dimension text. The dimension text will
always be placed on a particular dimension plane the orientation of which will be
automatically determined based on the input plane and sketch point to which the
dimension is being applied. The dimension plane is a transient geometric plane which
is only used to define the placement plane for the dimension text and does not have a
graphical representation. If no input is specified for the position of the dimension text,
a default position on the dimension plane will be calculated and used to place the
dimension text. If a valid point for the dimension text is specified, then either of the
following conditions will apply: * If the specified point already lies on the dimension
plane, then this point will be directly used to place the dimension text. * If the
specified point does not lie on the dimension plane, it will be projected onto the
dimension plane. Therefore, the resultant placement position for the dimension text
will be different from the specified one. The GetDimensionPlane method of the
DimensionConstraints3D object can be used to get the dimension plane object which
provides access to the dimension plane geometry.
This is an optional argument whose default value is null.
Driven Boolean
Specifies whether the dimension should be a driven or driving dimension. The default
value is False, which causes a driving dimension constraint to be created.
This is an optional argument whose default value is False.

DimensionConstraints3D Object Page 3 of 10
file:///C:/Users/Cliente/AppData/Local/Temp/~hhF7A7.htm 16/06/2025
Parameters
Name Type Description
Entity SketchEntity3D Input SketchCircle3D or SketchArc3D object.
TextPoint Variant
The dimension text can only be placed on the plane that contains the two input sketch
lines to which the dimension is being applied. The orientation of this dimension plane
will be automatically determined using the input sketch lines. The dimension plane is
a transient geometric plane which is only used to define the placement plane for the
dimension text and does not have a graphical representation. The position of the text
point defines which of the four quadrants on the dimension plane the constraint is
placed within.
If no input is specified for the position of the dimension text, a default position on the
dimension plane will be calculated and used to place the dimension text.
If a valid point for the dimension text is specified, then either of the following
conditions will apply: * If the specified point already lies on the dimension plane,
then this point will be directly used to place the dimension text. * If the specified
point does not lie on the dimension plane, it will be projected onto the dimension
plane. Therefore, the resultant placement position for the dimension text will be
different from the specified one. The GetDimensionPlane method of the
DimensionConstraints3D object can be used to get the dimension plane object which
provides access to the dimension plane geometry.
This is an optional argument whose default value is null.
Driven Boolean
Optional input Boolean that specifies whether the dimension should be a driven or
driving dimension. The default value is False, which causes a driving dimension
constraint to be created.
This is an optional argument whose default value is False.

PointTwo Object
SketchPoint3D, Vertex or WorkPoint object that defines the second point being constrained.
At least one of the input points (PointOne or PointTwo) for the dimension constraint must be
a SketchPoint3D object. If a 3D sketch point is specified for either PointOne or PointTwo
and a vertex or workpoint is specified for the other point, then a 3D sketch point will be
created at the specified vertex or workpoint and then the constraint will be applied between
the two 3D sketch points.
TextPoint Variant
Point object that defines the position of the dimension text. The dimension text will always
be placed on a particular dimension plane the orientation of which will be automatically
determined based on the input plane and sketch point to which the dimension is being

Parameters
Name Type Description
Entities ObjectCollection
ObjectCollection that contains the entity objects that represents the entities for which
the dimension plane has to be determined. The objects in this collection should
normally contain the same objects that would be supplied as inputs to create a
dimension constraint.
Remarks
The dimension plane is a transient geometric plane which is only used to define the placement plane for the
dimension text and does not have a graphical representation. The orientation of the dimension plane will be
automatically determined using the sketch entities when they are dimensioned. The dimension text will always be
placed on this dimension plane. This method can be used to determine this dimension plane prior to actually
creating the dimension constraint. The geometric information about the dimension plane could be used to
calculate a 3D point that lies on the plane. This point can then be supplied as input for the position for the
dimension text when creating the dimension constraint in which case the resultant position of the dimension text
will be the same as the specified input placement point. On the other hand, if a placement point that does not lie
on the dimension plane is specified as the position for the dimension text, it will be projected onto the dimension
plane and the dimension text will be placed at this projected point. The following table shows the combination of
the types of input objects that can be used to determine the dimension plane for the various dimension constraints.
This combination matches the input types that will be supplied to actually create the corresponding dimension
constraint. Dimension Constraint Objects in collection ------------------------------------- -------------------------

Samples
Name Description
Client
Graphics -
Draw
Range Box
This sample demonstrates the use of client graphics to draw the range box of selected entities.
Client
graphics
texturebased
color
mapping
This test applies texture coordinates expressing distance from the origin to 'the triangle mesh of
whatever Part you have open. It then creates either a discrete-band or continuous color mapper and
allows you to adjust the values of the mapper to change the range of values that map to various colors.
Client
Graphics -
Vertex
Color by Z
Height
This sample demonstrates using client graphics and some other functions that help to support display
control. It uses the currently active part and replaces the part display with a display where the part's
color varies from blue to red where blue is assigned to the lowest Z portion of the part and red is
assigned to the highest Z portion of the part. Areas in between are represented by a smooth blend of
color from blue to red.
Client
Graphics -
Line
This sample demonstrates the creation of custom graphics using LineGraphics and LineStripGraphics.
The same set of coordinate data is used for both types of graphics. Line graphics use two coordinates to
define a line, and then the next two coordinates to define the next line, and so on through the defined
coordinates. For the data provided, this results in gaps in the drawn curve. Line strips use the first two
coordinates to define the first line and then the last point of the first line becomes the first point of the
second line and the next coordinate is used as the end point of the second line. This results in the set of
points being connected by a continuous set of lines, drawing a continuous curve. This sample also
demonstrates two methods of defining the color for client graphics. In one case it uses an existing
appearance asset, and in the other, it explicitly defines a color and assigns it. To use the sample you need
to have an assembly or part document open. The program has two behaviors: the first time it is run it
will draw the graphics. The second time it is run it deletes the previously drawn graphics.
Client
Graphics -
Triangle
This sample demonstrates the creation of client graphics triangles using triange fans and strips. It does
this by drawing a cylinder. The end caps are triangle fans and the cylinder is made from a triangle strip.

Parent Object: Document
Description
Document Object Page 41 of 43
file:///C:/Users/Cliente/AppData/Local/Temp/~hhFC37.htm 16/06/2025
Method that performs compute operations on all of the entities within this Document's scope that may be out of date
with respect to their driving entities.
Syntax
Document.Update2( [AcceptErrorsAndContinue] As Boolean ) As Boolean
Parameters
Name Type Description
AcceptErrorsAndContinue Boolean
Optional argument that specifies if errors should be ignored and the update
completed or if the update should be aborted if an error occurs. If the
IgnoreErrors argument is set to True, errors are skipped and the update process
continues. If IgnoreErrors is set to False, the method returns as soon as the first
error is encountered.
This is an optional argument whose default value is True.
Remarks
The method should return False if any error is encountered during the update process (regardless of the IgnoreErrors
argument). The IgnoreErrors argument just specifies whether to stop and return as soon as the first error is
encountered or to continue on and finish the update by accepting the errors. A failed re-compute must be handled in a
similar manner as through the UI, because typically such failures require some intuitive interpretation. This means
examining the model. In API terms, this involves iterating through the parts and features, checking their HealthStatus
values. A useful technique is to use SetEndOfPart to help confirm whether an error disappears when part of the model
is excluded.

In-place activating a document within the context of an assembly does not cause it to be
the active document. In this case the document being in-place activated becomes the active edit
object, but not the active document. The top-level assembly that the edit is taking place within
remains the active document.

DocumentEvents.OnChange Event
Parent Object: DocumentEvents
Description
Fires when this document changes, supplying the reasons for change and the context in which this
action is being taken.
Syntax
DocumentEvents.OnChange( ReasonsForChange As CommandTypesEnum, BeforeOrAfter As
EventTimingEnum, Context As NameValueMap, HandlingCode As HandlingCodeEnum )
Parameters
Name Type Description
ReasonsForChange CommandTypesEnum
This argument indicates the type of change that
occurred. The value is from the CommandTypesEnum
list, which represents the different categories of
changes that can be made. Typically this will be a
single value from the list but it can represent multiple
values that have been combined together so you need
to use bitwise operations to check for a specific
change.
BeforeOrAfter EventTimingEnum
This argument specifies if the notification is being
sent before a change is made (kBefore), after a change
is made (kAfter), or when a change has been aborted
(kAbort).
Context NameValueMap Input NameValueMap object that can be used to
determine the context of why the event fired. This
argument provides additional information as described
below:
DocumentEvents Object Page 3 of 10
file:///C:/Users/Cliente/AppData/Local/Temp/~hh2E7E.htm 16/06/2025
Name = "DisplayName", Value = The display name of
the command that caused the change. This name will
change based on the language currently being used for
Inventor.
Name = "InternalName", Value = The internal name
of the command that caused the change. This name
will be consistent regardless of the current language.
Name = "InternalNamesList", Value = as follows.
When the internal name is "CompositeChange" this
value is returned. Some commands result in making
several changes but combine or composite them into a
single command. The individual changes that were
composited into the single command are provided
through this value. It is an array of strings that consist
of the internal names of the individual changes made.
For example, if you drag a sketch point that connects
two lines, the display name is "Drag Sketch
Inference", the internal name is "CompositeChange"
and the internal names list is an array of the following
three strings; "Modify Point", "Modify Line", and
"Modify Line".
Name = "ConsideredDirty", Value = "". If this name
appears in the context list then the change made is one
that causes the document to be dirty.
HandlingCode HandlingCodeEnum
Output HandlingCodeEnum that indicates how you
are handling the event. This event supports the ability
to cancel the change. By setting this argument to
kEventCanceled when the BeforeOrAfter argument is
kBefore Inventor will abort the change. When the
change is cancelled, this event is fired again but the
BeforeOrAfter argument will have a value of kAbort.
Remarks
The notification is not sent for commands that do not change the document, i.e. measure and view
commands. Care needs to be taken when using this event because changes to the document are
made so frequently that depending on what you do in response to the event it can degrade the
performance of Inventor. You should perform simple checks first to see if the change is one that
you're interested in before you perform more expensive operations. Whenever possible you should
use more specific events instead of this general change event. For example, if you're interested in
knowing when a parameter value changes you can listen to the
ModelingEvents.OnParameterChange event instead. This is both simpler for you and more
efficient, but not all actions that can occur within Inventor have corresponding events so in many
cases using the OnChange event is the only solution. There is also a corresponding
OnDocumentChange event on the ApplicationEvents object. The OnDocumentChange event
notifies clients for changes in all documents. Whereas the OnChange event only sends notification
for changes made to the document the event object was obtained from.

The OnChangeSelectSet event notifies a client when the contents of the select set have changed.
Syntax
DocumentEvents.OnChangeSelectSet( BeforeOrAfter As EventTimingEnum, Context As
NameValueMap, HandlingCode As HandlingCodeEnum )
Parameters
Name Type Description
BeforeOrAfter EventTimingEnum
Input that indicates when the event is fired. This notification
is only provided after the contents of the select set have
changed so the value of this argument will always be kAfter.
Context NameValueMap
Input that specifies additional context information regarding
the event. No context information is provided for this event.
HandlingCode HandlingCodeEnum
Output that specifies how Autodesk Inventor is to handle the
event. This argument is ignored for this event.
Remarks
This notification is sent when items are added or removed from the select set and when the select
set is cleared. The current contents of the select set can be obtained through the document's
SelectSet object. Note. You can get what appears to be double notifications of this event when an
object is already selected and the end-user selects another object. In this case the first notification
is because the current object(s) in the select set are being removed and the second notification is
for the new entity being added.

the event fired. This event provides additional information
through the Context argument as described below: Name =
"HealthStatusEnum", Value = The health status of the
document. If this value is anything other than
kUpToDateHealth you know the Document object returned
is not in a state where you can use most of its methods or
properties.

Parameters
Name Type Description
Entity Object The Entity that is being deleted. When the value of the
BeforeOrAfter argument is kBefore, the object provided is
the object before it is deleted. When the value is kAfter, an
object is also provided but since the actual entity has been
deleted calling any methods or properties on the object will
fail. The only thing that is valid to do with the object at this
time is to compare it's identity with a reference previously
saved. For example: Private m_oDeletedEntity As Object
Private Sub oDocEvents_OnDelete(ByVal Entity As Object,
ByVal BeforeOrAfter As EventTimingEnum, ...) If
BeforeOrAfter = kBefore Then ' Check to see if the Entity
being deleted is an interesting one. ' For example, it could
have an attribute attached to it. If Interesting(Entity) Then '
Save a reference to the object. Set m_oDeletedEntity =
Entity End If Else ' Now we're either after the delete or it's

Parent Object: DocumentInterests
Description
Method that creates a new DocumentInterest.
DocumentInterests Object Page 1 of 5
file:///C:/Users/Cliente/AppData/Local/Temp/~hh6443.htm 16/06/2025
Syntax
DocumentInterests.Add( ClientId As String, Name As String, InterestType As
DocumentInterestTypeEnum, [DataVersion] As Long, [ClientData] As Variant ) As
DocumentInterest
Parameters
Name Type Description
ClientId String
Input String that uniquely identifies a client. This is
the CLSID of the AddIn in a string form, e.g.
"{C9A6C580-3817-11D0-BE4E-080036E87B02}".
Name String
Input String that specifies the name associated with
this interest. This is typically a string specifying the
document 'sub-type'.
InterestType DocumentInterestTypeEnum
Input DocumentInterestTypeEnum that specifies the
type of interest that the client has in this document.
Valid inputs are kInterested and kNotInterested.
DataVersion Long
Optional input Long that specifies the current data
version of the document. If not specified, this is
assumed to be a 'non-migrating' type of interest. When
a document is opened, if this DataVersion value is less
than the current DataVersion value of the AddIn
(ApplicationAddIn.DataVersion), the 'Migrate'
command is enabled. When the user invokes the
Migrate command, the OnMigrateDocument event is
fired and gives the client an opportunity to migrate
their data.
This is an optional argument whose default value is -1.
ClientData Variant
Optional input String that contains some additional
data that the client would like to store with the interest.
This string is not interpreted by Inventor. Clients are
expected to use the string with extreme economy.
This is an optional argument whose default value is
null.
Remarks
The new created DocumentInterest is returned. The method fails if a DocumentInterest with the
same ClientId already exists. Note: Clients are strongly warned to store as little data as practicably
possible, partly to avoid capacity issues, but mainly because this will affect Inventor's ability to
open documents quickly in a 'lightweight' background mode.

Syntax
DraftAnalyses.Add( StartAngle As Double, EndAngle As Double, PullDirection As Object,
[Reversed] As Boolean, [Faces] As Variant, [GradientDisplay] As Boolean, [DisplayQuality] As
Long, [Name] As String ) As DraftAnalysis
Parameters
Name Type Description
StartAngle Double
Input Double that defines the start angle for the draft analysis. The
units for the input value will be assumed to be radians. If a value in
another units (e.g. degrees) or a string expression needs to be used, the
methods of the UnitsOfMeasure object can be used to first convert that
value to the corresponding double value in radians units. The converted
double value in radians units can then be specified as the input value
for this argument.
EndAngle Double
Input Double that defines the end angle for the draft analysis. The units
for the input value will be assumed to be radians. If a value in another
units (e.g. degrees) or a string expression needs to be used, the methods
of the UnitsOfMeasure object can be used to first convert that value to
the corresponding double value in radians units. The converted double
value in radians units can then be specified as the input value for this
argument.
PullDirection Object
Input Object that defines the direction in which the draft is applied.
This can be any one of the following: * Face - planar, cylindrical,
conical or torus
For a planar face, the normal direction of the face will be used as the
pull direction. For a cylindrical, conical or torus face, the axis direction
of the face will be used as the pull direction. * Edge * WorkPlane *
WorkAxis
Face and edges that belong to surfaces can also be used to specify the
pull direction for the draft analysis. The same limitations that apply for
the pull direction when creating a draft analysis interactively through
the command also apply when creating a draft analysis using the API.
Reversed Boolean
Optional input Boolean that specifies whether the pull direction of the
draft should be reversed. If no value is explicitly specified, then a
default value of False will be assumed to indicate that the pull direction
will not be reversed.
This is an optional argument whose default value is False.
Faces Variant Optional input Variant that specifies an ObjectCollection containing
the faces for the draft analysis. If no value is specified for this
argument, then all faces in the part will be used for the draft analysis. If
only a specific set of faces need to be used for the draft analysis, then
they have to be specified as an ObjectCollection. The input collection
DraftAnalyses Object Page 2 of 5
file:///C:/Users/Cliente/AppData/Local/Temp/~hhC6D6.htm 16/06/2025
can contain a combination of Face and WorkSurface objects. If
WorkSurface objects are specified, then all faces of the WorkSurface
will be used for the draft analysis.
This is an optional argument whose default value is null.
GradientDisplay Boolean
Optional input Boolean that specifies whether the draft analysis results
should be displayed as a color gradient. If a value of True is specified,
then the draft analysis results will be displayed as a color gradient. If a
value of False is specified, then the draft analysis results will be
displayed as discrete color bands. If no value is explicitly specified,
then a default value of False will be assumed to indicate that the draft
analysis results should be displayed as discrete color bands.
This is an optional argument whose default value is False.
DisplayQuality Long
Optional input Long that specifies the resolution or surface quality for
the color gradient or color bands that represent the draft analysis
results. The value indicates a scale, the valid values are in the range of
0 and 10. The specified value will then be interpreted in terms of the
percentage value which is the type of value that is specified
interactively through the command. For example, if a value of 1 is
specified for this argument, this will be indicate a value of 10
percentage.
This is an optional argument whose default value is 0.
Name String
Optional input String that specifies the name of the draft analysis. If not
specified, Inventor assigns a name to the draft analysis.
This is an optional argument whose default value is """".

treated as the base sketch entity. * Specifying only the base
sketch entity and automatically including connected entities. The
base sketch entity should be specified as the only item in the
collection. The IncludeConnectedEntities boolean argument
should be specified as True to indicate that all entities that form
a loop (open or closed) which contains the base sketch entity
should be automatically included to be offset. Since only one of
the above options to specify a group of connected entities can be
used at the same time and not both, if the collection contains
multiple entities, it implies that the collection is being used to
explicitly specify an exact set of sketch entities to offset, in
which case the IncludeConnectedEntities argument should be
False. If True is specified, the method will fail and the sketch
entities will not be offset.
OffsetDistance Double
Specifies the offset distance for the base sketch entity (the
sketch entity specified by the first item in the SketchEntities
collection). Since a group of connected entities that need to be
offset will all be offset by the same distance, it implies that the
distance value specified by this argument will be used not only
for the base sketch entity but also for all the remaining
connected sketch entities. Since the offset of the base sketch
entity can lie on either side of the base entity, the offset distance
in itself does not provide sufficient information regarding the
final position for the offset of the base sketch entity. The
NaturalOffsetDirection boolean argument can be used to specify
one out of the two possible offset directions for the base sketch
entity. Thus, the offset distance specified by this argument and
the offset direction specified by the NaturalOffsetDirection
boolean argument together determine the final position for the
offset of the base sketch entity. Once the offset position for the
base sketch entity is determined, the offset positions for any
other additional connected sketch entities can be inferred.
NaturalOffsetDirection Boolean Value that can be used to specify one out of the two possible
offset directions. This argument applies to the base sketch entity
(the sketch entity specified by the first item in the SketchEntities
collection). The natural offset direction is along the natural
normal direction at any point on the base sketch entity which inturn
is defined as the cross-product of the vector representing the
tangent at that point and the vector representing the sketch
normal. If True is specified, then the points on the offset of the
base sketch entity will be positioned in the direction specified by
the natural normal at the corresponding points on the original
base sketch entity. If False is specified, then the offset of the
base sketch entity will be positioned in the direction opposite to
that of the natural normal. Thus, this argument determines on
which side of the base sketch entity the offset of the base sketch
entity will be placed. Since this argument specifies only the
DrawingSketch Object Page 18 of 34
file:///C:/Users/Cliente/AppData/Local/Temp/~hhEFC.htm 16/06/2025
offset direction, the OffsetDistance argument has to be used to
specify the offset distance along the offset direction specified by
this argument. Thus, the offset direction specified by this
argument and the offset distance specified by the OffsetDistance
argument together determine the final position for the offset of
the base sketch entity. Once the offset position for the base
sketch entity is determined, the offset positions for any other
additional connected sketch entities can be inferred.
IncludeConnectedEntities Boolean
Value that specifies whether all entities that form a loop
containing the base sketch entity should also be offset. If True is
specified, then all loop entities will be offset. But, if the sketch
has multiple loops that contain the base sketch entity in which
case it will not be possible to uniquely determine a single loop
that needs to be offset, only the base sketch entity will be offset.
If False is specified, then only the entities specified in the
SketchEntities collection will be offset. If True is specified, the
SketchEntities collection should contain only one item that
corresponds to the base sketch entity, otherwise, if the
SketchEntities collection contains multiple entities, then this
method will fail and the sketch entities will not be offset. If
False is specified, the SketchEntities collection can contain
either a single item that corresponds to the base sketch entity or
multiple items that correspond to a group of end-to-end
connected entities. If the collection contains a single item that
corresponds to the base sketch entity, then only this base sketch
entity will be offset. On the other hand, if the collection contains
multiple items, it implies that the collection is being used to
specify an exact set of sketch entities to offset, hence, only those
exact set of sketch entities will be offset. If no value is specified
for this argument, then a default value of False will be assumed.
This is an optional argument whose default value is False.
CreateOffsetConstraints Boolean
Value that specifies whether offset constraints between the
original and offset entities should be automatically created. If
True is specified, then offset constraints will be automatically
created. If False is specified, then offset constraints will not be
created. If no value is specified, then a default value of True will
be assumed to indicate that the offset constraints will be
automatically created.
This is an optional argument whose default value is True.

Method
Parent Object: DrawingSketch
Description
DrawingSketch Object Page 19 of 34
file:///C:/Users/Cliente/AppData/Local/Temp/~hhEFC.htm 16/06/2025
Method that offsets a sketch entity or a group of end-to-end connected sketch entities. In both cases, the offset
is first applied to the base sketch entity such that the offset of the base sketch entity passes through the
specified offset point on the sketch. The shortest distance of this offset point from the original base sketch
entity determines the offset distance.
Syntax
DrawingSketch.OffsetSketchEntitiesUsingPoint( SketchEntities As ObjectCollection, OffsetPoint As
Point2d, [IncludeConnectedEntities] As Boolean, [CreateOffsetConstraints] As Boolean ) As
SketchEntitiesEnumerator
Parameters
Name Type Description
SketchEntities ObjectCollection
ObjectCollection that specifies either a single sketch entity or a
set of sketch entities that need to be offset. The collection can
contain any SketchEntity object except SketchPoint because
sketch points cannot be offset. The first entity in the collection is
always treated as the base sketch entity. The offset distance
(OffsetDistance argument) and the offset direction
(NaturalOffsetDirection argument) apply to this base sketch
entity. If only one sketch entity needs to be offset, then it should
be specified as the only item in the collection and the
IncludeConnectedEntities argument should be specified as False.
Since the entity specified in the collection is the first and only
item in the collection, it will be treated as the base sketch entity.
If a group of end\-to\-end connected sketch entities need to be
offset, then they can be specified using one of the following
options\: * Specifying an exact set of sketch entities to offset.
The collection can be used to specify an exact set of sketch
entities that need to be offset. The objects in the collection must
represent entities that are end-to-end connected and the
collection must contain the objects in the order that they are
connected. The first entity specified in the collection will be
treated as the base sketch entity. * Specifying only the base
sketch entity and automatically including connected entities. The
base sketch entity should be specified as the only item in the
collection. The IncludeConnectedEntities boolean argument
should be specified as True to indicate that all entities that form
a loop (open or closed) which contains the base sketch entity
should be automatically included to be offset.
Since only one of the above options to specify a group of
connected entities can be used at the same time and not both, if
the collection contains multiple entities, it implies that the
collection is being used to explicitly specify an exact set of
sketch entities to offset, in which case the
IncludeConnectedEntities argument should be False. If True is
specified, the method will fail and the sketch entities will not be
offset.
OffsetPoint Point2d Defines a point on the sketch through which the offset of the
base sketch entity (the sketch entity specified by the first item in
the SketchEntities collection) should pass. The shortest distance
of this point from the base sketch entity is used to determine the
offset distance. This offset distance will also be used to offset
any other additional connected sketch entities. The location of
DrawingSketch Object Page 20 of 34
file:///C:/Users/Cliente/AppData/Local/Temp/~hhEFC.htm 16/06/2025
the point with respect to the base sketch entity determines the
position of the offset base sketch entity (i.e. the location of the
point determines on which side of the base sketch entity the
offset of the base sketch entity will be positioned). Once the
offset distance and position for the offset of the base sketch
entity are determined, this information is used to determine the
position for all other connected sketch entities that need to be
offset. Thus, the offset point provides sufficient information to
calculate the offset distance as well as the offset direction for all
the sketch entities that need to be offset.
IncludeConnectedEntities Boolean
Value that specifies whether all entities that form a loop
containing the base sketch entity should also be offset. If True is
specified, then all loop entities will be offset. But, if the sketch
has multiple loops that contain the base sketch entity in which
case it will not be possible to uniquely determine a single loop
that needs to be offset, only the base sketch entity will be offset.
If False is specified, then only the entities specified in the
SketchEntities collection will be offset. If True is specified, the
SketchEntities collection should contain only one item that
corresponds to the base sketch entity, otherwise, if the
SketchEntities collection contains multiple entities, then this
method will fail and the sketch entities will not be offset. If
False is specified, the SketchEntities collection can contain
either a single item that corresponds to the base sketch entity or
multiple items that correspond to a group of end\-to\-end
connected entities. If the collection contains a single item that
corresponds to the base sketch entity, then only this base sketch
entity will be offset. On the other hand, if the collection contains
multiple items, it implies that the collection is being used to
specify an exact set of sketch entities to offset, hence, only those
exact set of sketch entities will be offset. If no value is specified
for this argument, then a default value of False will be assumed.
This is an optional argument whose default value is False.
CreateOffsetConstraints Boolean
Value that specifies whether offset constraints between the
original and offset entities should be automatically created. If
True is specified, then offset constraints will be automatically
created. If False is specified, then offset constraints will not be
created. If no value is specified, then a default value of True will
be assumed to indicate that the offset constraints will be
automatically created.
This is an optional argument whose default value is True.

Method that takes a 2d coordinate in sheet space, and returns a Point2d
object containing the coordinate point in drawing view space.
SheetToModelSpace
Method that takes a 2d coordinate in sheet space, and returns a Line in
model space. Since this method transforms from 2D space to 3D space,
there is insufficient information to obtain a 3D model point. Hence, this
method returns a Line in the view direction on which the point lies. You
may then use the FindUsingRay method to find the point(s) of interest.
ShowHiddenAnnotations Method that displays all the annotations hidden by the user.
ShowHiddenCurves Method that displays all the curves explicitly hidden by the user.

Description
DSLoadDefinition Object.
Methods
Name Description
Copy
Creates a copy of this DSLoadDefinition object. The new DSLoadDefinition
object is independent of any load. It can edited and used as input to edit an
existing load or to create a new load. Creating a copy of a definition, editing it,
and then assigning it back to the load can be a more efficient way of editing
multiple inputs because it results in a single recompute.
SetByMagnitudeAndDirection
Specifies the direction and magnitude of this load to be defined by a magnitude
value and a direction defined by an entity.
SetByVector
Specifies the direction and magnitude of this load to be defined by the x, y, z
components of a vector.
