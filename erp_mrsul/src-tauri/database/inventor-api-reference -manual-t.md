case when the first constraint on a part is a mate constraint. In the case
where the mate is between two planes, the parts can be positioned
anywhere along the infinite plane that defines their mating contact. Using
the bias points you can define the position of the two occurrences, relative
to each other. If a bias point is not given, one is calculated that is at the
center of the parameter range of the input entity.

EntityTwo Object Input object that defines the second object. This object is a circular edge.
InsideTangency Boolean Input Boolean that specifies the orientation of the surfaces at the tangent contact point of the surfaces.
Offset Variant
Input Variant that defines the offset between the two input entities. This can be either a numeric value or a
string. A parameter for this value is created and the supplied string or value is assigned to the parameter. If a
value is input, the units are centimeters. If a string is input the units can be specified as part of the string or
will default to the current length units of the document.
BiasPointOne Variant
Optional input Point object that is used help in determining the initial position of the occurrence. The
occurrences are repositioned in an attempt to make the two bias points coincident. This provides some
general control over the position of the occurrence when it isn't being controlled by another constraint.
An example of when the bias points are useful is the case when the first constraint on a part is a mate
constraint. In the case where the mate is between two planes, the parts can be positioned anywhere along the
infinite plane that defines their mating contact. Using the bias points you can define the position of the two
occurrences, relative to each other.
If a bias point is not given, one is calculated that is at the center of the parameter range of the input entity.
This is an optional argument whose default value is null.
BiasPointTwo Variant

Parameters
Name Type Description
TransactionObject Transaction
The Transaction object being aborted. When the
BeforeOrAfter argument is kBefore this is the Transaction
being aborted and it supports the full functionality of a
Transaction object. When the BeforeOrAfter argument is
kAfter the Transaction object no longer exists so the object
provided by this argument is not functional except to
compare its identity to another Transaction object.

Parameters
Name Type Description
TransactionObject Transaction
The Transaction object just deleted. When the
BeforeOrAfter argument is kAfter the actual Transaction
has been deleted and the Transaction object provided is
not functional except to have it's identify compared with a
previously saved reference to a Transaction object. For
example: Private m_oSavedTransaction As Transaction
Private Sub oTransActionEvents_OnCommit( ByVal

deleted. If TransactionObject is m_oSavedTransaction
Then ' The transaction was deleted. End If End If End Sub
Context NameValueMap
Input object that can be used to determine the context of
why the event fired. No context information is provided
for this event.
BeforeOrAfter EventTimingEnum
Input indicating when the event is being fired. Notification
is sent only after the transaction is deleted.
Remarks
The transaction stack contains a list of all transactions that can be undone or redone. Transactions
are deleted as the result of three things. First, the transaction stack has a fixed number of
transactions it can hold, (which is defined in the registry). When the number of transactions goes
over this limit, the transactions at the bottom of the stack are deleted. This means they can no
longer be undone. The second reason a transaction is deleted is when a transaction is undone and
then another transaction is committed. All transactions in the undone state are deleted and can't be
redone. The third reason is as a result of a document being closed. Whenever a document is closed
the entire transaction stack is cleared. All transactions in the stack will be deleted.

graphics. You must have a part or assembly open and select a part of sat file
which will be read in and displayed as client graphics. Depending on our
responses to the program it will create the graphics so that only the node is
selectable (which is all that was supported before), so that all of the primitives
are selected, or so that only certain primitives are selectable (every other face in
this case).

This sample demonstrates much of the wire body creation functionality. To run
the sample you must have a part open and select a planar face. This sample then
creates a trasient wire body using the geometry of the outside of the selected
face. It then transforms and offsets that wire, and finally creates a ruled surface
between the original wire and the offset wire. A base feature is created with the
ruled surface.

TransientBRep.DeleteFaces Method
Parent Object: TransientBRep
Description
Method that modifies an existing transient surface body by deleting specified faces.
Syntax
TransientBRep.DeleteFaces( Faces As Object, DeleteSpecifiedFaces As Boolean )
Parameters
Name Type Description
Faces Object
Input Object to specifies the Face object(s) to either delete or
save. This argument can be a single Face object or it can be a
FaceCollection to specify more than one face. Depending on the
value of the second argument these faces will be deleted or saved
in the SurfaceBody. If a FaceCollection is provided as input all of
the input faces must exist within the same transient SurfaceBody
object.
DeleteSpecifiedFaces Boolean
Input Boolean that indicates if the face(s) specified in the Faces
argument should be deleted or saved. If True, then the specified
face(s) will be deleted from the SurfaceBody. If False, the
specified face(s) will be saved and all other faces in the
SurfaceBody will be deleted.

TransientBRep.DoBoolean Method
Parent Object: TransientBRep
Description
Method that performs the specified Boolean operation between the blank and tool bodies.
Syntax
TransientBRep.DoBoolean( BlankBody As SurfaceBody, ToolBody As SurfaceBody,
BooleanType As BooleanTypeEnum )
Parameters
Name Type Description
BlankBody SurfaceBody Input/Output SurfaceBody that will be modified as a result.
ToolBody SurfaceBody Input SurfaceBody that is used to operate on the blank body.
BooleanType BooleanTypeEnum
Input BooleanTypeEnum that specifies the type of Boolean
operation to perform. Valid values are
kBooleanTypeDifference, kBooleanTypeUnion, and
kBooleanTypeIntersect.
Remarks
If successful, the blank body is modified as a result of the Boolean operation. Because of this the
BlankBody must always be a transient SurfaceBody. The toolbody is not modified. This is
analogous to a machining operation where you have the blank that is being machined and the tool
that removes material.

use when comparing the bodies. If not specified, or a
value of zero is specified, the internal modeling
tolerance will be used.
This is an optional argument whose default value is
0.0.
Remarks
TransientBRep Object Page 14 of 18
file:///C:/Users/Cliente/AppData/Local/Temp/~hh4D59.htm 17/06/2025
The picture below shows an example of imprinting. The picture on the left shows the initial two
bodies that are positioned so there are coincident faces. The picture on the right shows the two
bodies individually so you can see the result of the imprint and how the coincident faces were
split.
The ability to imprint solids can be important to applications that need to mesh models. By
creating edges at the poins where solids connect, it guarantees that there will be mesh nodes along
those boundaries.

file:///C:/Users/Cliente/AppData/Local/Temp/~hhC420.htm 17/06/2025
Angle Variant Input Variant that defines the angle between the two input entities.
This can be either a numeric value or a string. A parameter for this
value is created and the supplied string or value is assigned to the
parameter. If a value is input, the units are radians. If a string is input
the units can be specified as part of the string or will default to the
current angle units of the document.
SolutionType AngleConstraintSolutionTypeEnum
Optional input AngleConstraintSolutionTypeEnum that specifies the
solution type. If specified to be kDirectedSolution, the solution
always applies the right hand rule. If specified to be
kUndirectedSolution, the solution allows either orientation, thus
resolving situations where component orientation flips during a
constraint drive or drag. If specified to be kReferenceVectorSolution,
the ReferenceVectorEntity argument must be provided with a third
entity for the solution. The default value is kDirectedSolution.
This is an optional argument whose default value is 78593.
ReferenceVectorEntity Variant
Optional input object that provides a third entity to solve the angle
constraint. This argument is ignored if the SolutionType argument is
not kReferenceVectorSolution. This object can be a planar face,
work plane, linear edge, work axis, or a face that defines an axis.

attempt to make the two bias points coincident. This provides some
general control over the position of the occurrence when it isn't being
controlled by another constraint. An example of when the bias points
are useful is the case when the first constraint on a part is a mate
constraint. In the case where the mate is between two planes, the
parts can be positioned anywhere along the infinite plane that defines
their mating contact. Using the bias points you can define the
position of the two occurrences, relative to each other. If a bias point
is not given, one is calculated that is at the center of the parameter
range of the input entity.
This is an optional argument whose default value is null.

Parameters
Name Type Description
EntityOne Object
Input object that defines the first object. This object can be a planar face, work
plane, linear edge, work axis, or a face that defines an axis.
EntityTwo Object
Input object that defines the second object. This object can be a planar face, work
plane, linear edge, work axis, or a face that defines an axis.
Angle Variant
Input Variant that defines the angle between the two input entities. This can be
either a numeric value or a string. A parameter for this value is created and the
supplied string or value is assigned to the parameter. If a value is input, the units
are radians. If a string is input the units can be specified as part of the string or will
default to the current angle units of the document.
SolutionType AngleConstraintSolutionTypeEnum
Optional input AngleConstraintSolutionTypeEnum that specifies the solution type.
If specified to be kDirectedSolution, the solution always applies the right hand
rule. If specified to be kUndirectedSolution, the solution allows either orientation,
thus resolving situations where component orientation flips during a constraint
drive or drag. If specified to be kReferenceVectorSolution, the
ReferenceVectorEntity argument must be provided with a third entity for the
solution. The default value is kDirectedSolution.
This is an optional argument whose default value is 78593.
ReferenceVectorEntity Variant
Optional input object that provides a third entity to solve the angle constraint. This

bias points coincident. This provides some general control over the position of the
occurrence when it isn't being controlled by another constraint. An example of
when the bias points are useful is the case when the first constraint on a part is a
mate constraint. In the case where the mate is between two planes, the parts can be
positioned anywhere along the infinite plane that defines their mating contact.
Using the bias points you can define the position of the two occurrences, relative
to each other. If a bias point is not given, one is calculated that is at the center of
the parameter range of the input entity.
This is an optional argument whose default value is null.

Optional input Point object that is used help in determining the initial position of the occurrence. The occurrences
are repositioned in an attempt to make the two bias points coincident. This provides some general control over the
position of the occurrence when it isn't being controlled by another constraint.
An example of when the bias points are useful is the case when the first constraint on a part is a mate constraint. In
the case where the mate is between two planes, the parts can be positioned anywhere along the infinite plane that
defines their mating contact. Using the bias points you can define the position of the two occurrences, relative to
each other.
If a bias point is not given, one is calculated that is at the center of the parameter range of the input entity.

This object can be a planar face, work plane, linear edge, work axis, or a face that
defines an axis.
This is an optional argument whose default value is null.
BiasPointOne Variant
Optional input Point object that is used help in determining the initial position of the
occurrence. The occurrences are repositioned in an attempt to make the two bias
points coincident. This provides some general control over the position of the
occurrence when it isn't being controlled by another constraint. An example of when
the bias points are useful is the case when the first constraint on a part is a mate
constraint. In the case where the mate is between two planes, the parts can be
positioned anywhere along the infinite plane that defines their mating contact. Using
the bias points you can define the position of the two occurrences, relative to each
other. If a bias point is not given, one is calculated that is at the center of the
parameter range of the input entity.
This is an optional argument whose default value is null.

FirstTime Boolean
The FirstTime flag, if True, indicates to the Addin that this is the
first time it is being loaded and to take some specific action. It
does not take these actions when this flag is False. Typically,
when the flag is True, the AddIn proceeds to create all of the
objects under the UserInterfaceManager that it needs -
Environments, Ribbons and Controls. These objects are persistent,
but if this is the first time the Addin is loaded, they need to be
created from scratch. When the FirstTime flag is False, meaning
the Addin has already been loaded, it only needs to create the
objects under the CommandManager - CommandCategories and
ControlDefinitions.
