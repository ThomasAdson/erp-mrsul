Add a punch tool
feature
This program demonstrates the creation of a punch tool feature. It uses one
of the punch features that's delivered with Inventor. It assumes you already
have an existing sheet metal part and have selected a face to place the punch
feature on. The selected face should be large so there is room for the punch
features.
Move sketch
entities
This sample demonstrates the translation of all the objects on the active
sketch by a certain distance.
Offset a 2D sketch
This sample demonstrates the creation of offsets in 2d sketches. Two ways of
creating the offset are shown - one uses a distance and the other uses the
input point.
Create sketched
symbol and leader
This sample illustrates creating sketched symbol with a leader.
Spline - create
NURBS
This sample demonstrates the creation of a sketch spline using a geometry
definition (a NURB). The API also supports creation of 3D sketch splines in
a similar way.
Sketch Spline This sample demonstrates creating and manipulating a sketch spline.
Transient surface
body creation
The following sample demonstrates the creation of a transient surface body
consisting of a single rectangular face. The body is created in transient space
and then copied over to a part document as a base feature.
Add surface texture
symbol to
dimension
This sample demonstrates the creation of a surface texture symbol attached
to the extension line of a drawing dimension.

FitPoints NameValueMap
Input NameValueMap object that contains an array of
ObjectCollection objects that each ObjectCollection specifies the fit
points for a spline curve on a face. The format is as below:
Name = “Face1”. Value = An ObjectCollection object that contains
the Point or SketchPoint3D objects which indicate the fit points
positions. The number in the Name is 1-based and can be increased for
more ObjectCollection objects to be added. The name in this argument

Description
Method that creates an ordinate dimension.

Parameters
Name Type Description
Intent GeometryIntent
OrdinateDimensions Object Page 1 of 8
file:///C:/Users/Cliente/AppData/Local/Temp/~hh8A3E.htm 16/06/2025
Input GeometryIntent object that specifies the geometry to
dimension. The GeometryIntent object can be created using the
Sheet.CreateGeometryIntent method. Valid intent values are points
that specify geometry to which an ordinate dimension can be
attached. For example, the start, mid, end point of lines and start,
end, center point of curves are valid intent values. If an invalid intent
is specified, this method will fail.
TextOrigin Point2d
Input Point2d object that specifies the position of the dimension text
on the sheet. The specified position of the dimension text together
with the dimension alignment type (specified by the DimensionType
argument) will determine the actual resulting position for the
dimension text. If the specified dimension text position lies along the
dimension line implied by the DimensionType argument, the
dimension text will be placed exactly at the specified position. On
the other hand, if the specified dimension text position does not lie
along the dimension line implied by the DimensionType argument,
the specified point will be projected onto the dimension line and the
dimension text will be placed at this projected point. The following
figures show how the specified position will be interpreted. In the
first figure, the dimension type is specified to be a horizontal
ordinate dimension and the specified point (P) lies on the horizontal
line (L), therefore the dimension text will be placed exactly at the
specified point (P).
In the second figure (shown below), the dimension type is
specified to be a horizontal ordinate dimension and the specified
point (P) does not lie on the horizontal line (L), therefore the point P
will be first projected onto the dimension line and this projected
point (P') will be used as the placement point for the dimension text.

DimensionType DimensionTypeEnum
Input DimensionTypeEnum that specifies the ordinate dimension
type. Valid values
kHorizontalDimensionType, kVerticalDimensionType and
kAlignedDimensionType. The
value kAlignedDimensionType can be specified only if the geometry
of the specified
input intent represents a line in which case an ordinate dimension
that is aligned
along the direction of the line will be created. An error will occur if
an invalid
dimension type is specified. For instance,
kArcLengthDimensionType, kDiametricDimensionType
and kSymmetricDimensionType are invalid for all types of intent
and kAlignedDimensionType
is invalid if the geometry of the specified input intent does not
represent a line.
The following figures show the aligned, horizontal and vertical
ordinate dimensions
for the same input intent (the geometry of the intent represents a line
whose direction
is used to place the aligned ordinate dimension).

DimensionStyle Variant
Optional input DimensionStyle object that specifies the dimension
style to use for the dimension. If not specified, the style defined by
the active standard is used.
This is an optional argument whose default value is null.
Layer Variant
Optional input Layer object that specifies the layer to use for the
dimension. If not specified, the layer defined by the active standard
is used.
This is an optional argument whose default value is null.
Remarks
The ordinate dimension will be placed with respect to an origin point defined on the view. If an origin point
has not been already defined on the view, this method will fail. The DrawingView.HasOriginIndicator
property can be used to verify if the origin has already been created. If it has not been created, the
DrawingView.CreateOriginIndicator method can be used to create it. The difference in behavior when
placing ordinate dimensions using the API (when compared to placing them interactively using the user
interface) is that ordinate dimensions have to be placed only one at a time using the API. To illustrate this
difference, consider the drawing view shown in the figure below which shows ordinate dimensions placed
on a curve.

Ordinate dimensions placed on a curve
The figure shows three ordinate dimensions placed on the start point, center point and end point of the
curve. When using the user interface, all three dimensions can be placed at the same time by starting the
ordinate dimension command and just selecting the curve entity (assuming that the origin for the ordinate
dimensions has already been selected, otherwise this has to be selected first). After the dimensions have
been placed, each one of them can be edited or deleted individually. Therefore, these dimensions are
independent without any relationship or grouping between them. Similarly, if the line is selected for placing
ordinate dimensions, two ordinate dimensions will be placed at the start point and end point of the line
respectively. The user interface merely allows the convenience of placing multiple dimensions
simultaneously, although they are independent. When placing these ordinate dimensions using the API, they
can only be placed one at a time. If the three dimensions shown in the figure need to be placed using the
API, this method needs to be called three times and the start point, center point and end point of the curve
has to be specified as input geometry intent. Therefore, the only acceptable input geometry intent for placing
an ordinate dimension is a point to which the ordinate dimension can be attached.
