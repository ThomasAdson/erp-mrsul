Camera Object
Description
The Camera defines the view of the model shown within the window.
Methods
Name Description
Apply
Method that causes the changes made to the Camera object to be
applied to the actual camera of the view. This will also cause the view
to update.
ApplyWithoutTransition Method that applies the current camera to the View without transition.
ComputeWithMouseInput
Method that changes the view according mouse movement and view
operation.
CreateImage Creates an image based on the current camera view.
CreateImageWithOptions Creates an image based on the current camera view with options.
Fit Method that fits all the contents of the Document into the view.
GetExtents
Method that gets the current extents of the camera. The camera extents
define the area within the model that is visible in the view.
ModelToViewSpace
Method that converts a point in model space to the equivalent point on
the view.
SaveAsBitmap
Method that saves the current camera view to the specified file. The
width and height arguments define the aspect ratio and the number of
pixels in the output image.
The CreateImage method is similar to this but instead of writing the
image to a file it creates it in memory, which is more efficient than
writing and reading if from disk if you need to use the image
immediately.
SetExtents
Method that sets the current extents of the camera. The camera extents
define the area within the model that is visible in the view. Setting the
extents results in the camera zooming in or out. The Apply method of
the camera must be called before any changes are shown in the view.
ViewToModelSpace
Method that converts a point in view space to the equivalent point in
the model.
Properties
Name Description
Eye Specifies the position of the observer's 'Eye' (View's center).

Name Description
OnExecute
Event that is fired when Inventor is in a state to accept changes to data. This is
the event where the client application executes its logic on the specified
document.
OnReadFromScript
Event that is fired in a replay scenario supplying the cached Inputs string. The
client application interprets the inputs and converts them into meaningful data
for use in the execution of logic in the OnExecute event. This event is always
followed by the OnExecute event.
OnTerminate
Event that is fired when this ChangeProcessor is done being used for the current
execution.
OnWriteToScript
Event that is fired before the execution of and commit of the change. The return
string should be set with a formatted string of the arguments. The string may be
persisted for eventual replay, such as a transcript replay. A semicolon (';')
character should be considered a reserved character used as a separator between
individual arguments. The recommended format would be a variable name value
pair separated by an equal character, with arguments separated by semicolons.

AxisEntity Object
CircularPatternFeatures Object Page 3 of 5
file:///C:/Users/Cliente/AppData/Local/Temp/~hhA4C.htm 16/06/2025
Input a linear entity that defines the rotation axis. This
can be a linear Edge, a WorkAxis, a
cylindrical/conical/spherical/toroidal Face (axis is used).
NaturalAxisDirection Boolean
Input Boolean that indicates if the direction of the pattern
is in the natural direction of the AxisEntity or reversed. A
value of True indicates it is in the natural direction.
Count Variant
Input Variant that defines the number of instances in the
pattern. This can be either a numeric value or a string. A
parameter will be created to control this value when the
feature is created. If a string is input it can be any string
that can be evaluated by Inventor to result in a unitless
number.
Angle Variant
Input Variant that defines the angle of the pattern. This
can be either a numeric value or a string. A parameter
will be created to control this value when the feature is
created. If a string is input it can be any string that can be
evaluated by Inventor to result in a unitless value
(document angular units will be used for it) or an angular
unit value.
FitWithinAngle Boolean
Optional input Boolean that defines how the count and
angle are used to space the occurrences. If this property is
true then the angle specifies the total sweep made by the
pattern and the occurrences are evenly spaced within the
angle. If it is false then the angle specifies the angular
offset between each occurrence. This defaults to True.
This is an optional argument whose default value is True.

FeatureInputs Variant
Optional input ObjectCollection that specifies the inputs use to create this
feature. The inputs are currently limited to 2D & 3D sketches. The inputs
must be above the feature in the browser. When sketches are specified as
inputs, the behavior is the same as a regular Inventor feature (such as
Extrude) consuming a sketch. The sketch appears under the client feature
and can be 'shared' by the user so it is usable in other downstream features.
The input objects are not 'strongly owned' by the client feature. i.e. when
the client feature is deleted, the user has the option to retain the feature
inputs. The feature inputs do not highlight with the client feature.
This is an optional argument whose default value is null.

selected entities.
Client
graphics
texture-based
color
mapping
This test applies texture coordinates expressing distance from the origin to 'the
triangle mesh of whatever Part you have open. It then creates either a discrete-band
or continuous color mapper and allows you to adjust the values of the mapper to
change the range of values that map to various colors.
Client
Graphics -
Vertex Color
by Z Height
This sample demonstrates using client graphics and some other functions that help
to support display control. It uses the currently active part and replaces the part
display with a display where the part's color varies from blue to red where blue is
assigned to the lowest Z portion of the part and red is assigned to the highest Z
portion of the part. Areas in between are represented by a smooth blend of color
from blue to red.
Client
Graphics -
Line
This sample demonstrates the creation of custom graphics using LineGraphics and
LineStripGraphics. The same set of coordinate data is used for both types of
graphics. Line graphics use two coordinates to define a line, and then the next two
coordinates to define the next line, and so on through the defined coordinates. For
the data provided, this results in gaps in the drawn curve. Line strips use the first
two coordinates to define the first line and then the last point of the first line
becomes the first point of the second line and the next coordinate is used as the end
point of the second line. This results in the set of points being connected by a
continuous set of lines, drawing a continuous curve. This sample also demonstrates
two methods of defining the color for client graphics. In one case it uses an existing
appearance asset, and in the other, it explicitly defines a color and assigns it. To use
the sample you need to have an assembly or part document open. The program has
two behaviors: the first time it is run it will draw the graphics. The second time it is
run it deletes the previously drawn graphics.

program it will create the graphics so that only the node is selectable (which is all
that was supported before), so that all of the primitives are selected, or so that only
certain primitives are selectable (every other face in this case).

Graphics -
Vertex
Color by Z
Height
This sample demonstrates using client graphics and some other functions that help
to support display control. It uses the currently active part and replaces the part
display with a display where the part's color varies from blue to red where blue is
assigned to the lowest Z portion of the part and red is assigned to the highest Z
portion of the part. Areas in between are represented by a smooth blend of color
from blue to red.
Client
Graphics -
Line
This sample demonstrates the creation of custom graphics using LineGraphics and
LineStripGraphics. The same set of coordinate data is used for both types of
graphics. Line graphics use two coordinates to define a line, and then the next two
coordinates to define the next line, and so on through the defined coordinates. For
the data provided, this results in gaps in the drawn curve. Line strips use the first
two coordinates to define the first line and then the last point of the first line
becomes the first point of the second line and the next coordinate is used as the end
point of the second line. This results in the set of points being connected by a
continuous set of lines, drawing a continuous curve. This sample also demonstrates
two methods of defining the color for client graphics. In one case it uses an existing
appearance asset, and in the other, it explicitly defines a color and assigns it. To use
the sample you need to have an assembly or part document open. The program has
two behaviors: the first time it is run it will draw the graphics. The second time it is
run it deletes the previously drawn graphics.

will be read in and displayed as client graphics. Depending on our responses to the
program it will create the graphics so that only the node is selectable (which is all
that was supported before), so that all of the primitives are selected, or so that only
certain primitives are selectable (every other face in this case).

ClientView.Update( Interactive As Boolean )
Parameters
Name Type Description
Interactive Boolean
Input Boolean that specifies the type of update to perform. Interactive update
should be used when the user is dynamically modifying the view. During
interactive update Autodesk Inventor takes steps to optimize the display in an
attempt to achieve a higher frame rate. For example it will create simplified
displays of parts and eliminate the display of small parts in assemblies.
Setting the Interactive argument to True allows Autodesk Inventor to
perform these optimizations. Setting this argument to False causes Autodesk
Inventor to perform a complete rendering without any optimizations.
Typically you will set the Interactive argument to True while the user is
dynamically modifying the view (while the mouse button is down). A final
update (When the mouse button is released) is performed with the Interactive
argument set to False to get an accurate rendering.

Description
The CommandManager object provides functionality that interacts with the various user
interaction events. See here for an overview.
Methods
Name Description
ClearPrivateEvents Clears the contents of Autodesk Inventor's internal clipboard.
CreateDragContext Method that creates a new DragContext object.
CreateInteractionEvents
Method that creates and returns a new InteractionEvents object. The
InteractionEvents object is created for document that is currently active.
CreateMiniToolbar Method that creates a MiniToolbar object.
DoPreSelect
Method that causes Autodesk Inventor to go through the pre-selection
protocol, including firing of corresponding event out the active
InteractionEvents object if one is active. If a native Autodesk Inventor
command is active and is in a selection mode, it gets the pre-select
notification just like a native pre-selection happened. This method is
useful when you want to perform picking outside of the graphic window.
For example if you have a browser that has icons that represent
selectable objects you can cause the selection behavior to happen as the
user navigates through your browser and selects objects.

objects you can cause the selection behavior to happen as the user
navigates through your browser and selects objects.
DoStopPreSelect
Method that causes Autodesk Inventor to go through the stop preselection
protocol, including firing of corresponding event out the active
InteractionEvents object if one is active. If a native Autodesk Inventor
command is active and is in a selection mode, it gets the stop pre-select
notification just like a native stop pre-selection happened. This method

PeekPrivateEvent
Method that queries data contained by Autodesk Inventor's internal
clipboard.
Pick Method that allows the user to pick a single entity.
PostPrivateEvent
Method that posts data onto Autodesk Inventor's internal clipboard.
Certain commands that usually obtain information using a dialog, i.e.
Open, Save, etc., look first to see if data is on the clipboard before
displaying the dialog. If valid information is on the clipboard the
command will use it instead of displaying the dialog and asking the user
to specify the filename.
PromptMessage
This method allows the developer to put up prompt messages (unless the
user has suppressed this prompt) much like the Visual Basic MsgBox
functionality.
StartExecutable
Method that causes the specified executable to be run. Using the
Parameters argument you can also pass arguments to the executable.
StopActiveCommand Method that causes the currently running command to be terminated.
Properties
Name Description
ActiveCommand Gets the active command (one that is currently running).
CommandCategories Property that returns the collection.
ControlDefinitions Property that returns the ControlDefinitions collection.
Parent Property that returns the parent document of the object.

Property that informs the client if Autodesk Inventor is currently in
selection mode or not. This may be used, for example, by clients to test if
calling the DoSelect (and related) methods will have any effect or not.
Type Returns an ObjectTypeEnum indicating this object's type.
UserInputEvents
Property that returns the object that fires events on all user input
(commands, keyboard, mouse, etc.).

CommandManager.DoSelect Method
Parent Object: CommandManager
Description
Method that causes Autodesk Inventor to go through the selection protocol, including firing of
corresponding event out the active InteractionEvents object if one is active. If a native Autodesk
Inventor command is active and is in a selection mode, it gets the select notification just like a
native selection happened. This method is useful when you want to perform picking outside of the
graphic window. For example if you have a browser that has icons that represent selectable objects
you can cause the selection behavior to happen as the user navigates through your browser and
selects objects.

Name Type Description
Prompt String
The string that will appear in the dialog. The string can include "%s" to
indicate a string placeholder, while you can specify the string value using
the PromptStrings argument. The string can also specify the hyperlink
with XML tags.
Buttons Long
Describes which buttons will be used, and which is the default answer.
For example "vbOKCancel + vbDefaultButton1", or "vbYesNo".
Title Variant
Each time you call the function, you can give it a new dialog title/caption.
If not supplied, the title will default to "Inventor x", where x is the release
number.
This is an optional argument whose default value is null.
DefaultAnswer Variant
The default response for the dialog. (vbOK, vbYes, etc.)
This is an optional argument whose default value is null.
Restrictions Variant The client can specify which of the "don't ask me" options to allow (these
options are grayed on the dialog). Also, in Inventor there is an option for
which window should get focus when you exit the dialog (default is the
mainframe window of Inventor). Zero or more of the following, in
combination (can be added together with +): General options
* kNoRestrictions (Allow all of the radio button options in the
dialog "Don't ask ever again", "Don't ask again this session", for all
buttons)
* kDontAllowNeverAgain (Disable the "Don't ever as again"
option)
* kDontAllowNoMoreThisSession (Disable the "Don't ask again
this session" option) Button 1 options (i.e. what is allowed/not
allowed if button 1 is picked)
* kDontAllowButton1NeverAgain (Disable the "Don't ever ask

it can indicate the parent window handler(HWND) for this prompt. If this
argument is String or String array, and the input Prompt value includes
"%s" then the "%s" will be replaced by this String value or String array
sequentially.
This is an optional argument whose default value is null.
Remarks
If you pick one of the radio buttons in the "Prompts" section of the dialog, the prompt and your
choice will be saved to the registry, and your selection will work for future uses of the prompt (i.e.
when the client calls the prompt, if the user has selected one of the "don't ask me" options, the
dialog is suppressed, and the answer specified earlier by the user is returned).

Name Description
Client
graphics
texture-based
color
mapping
This test applies texture coordinates expressing distance from the origin to 'the triangle mesh of whatever
Part you have open. It then creates either a discrete-band or continuous color mapper and allows you to
adjust the values of the mapper to change the range of values that map to various colors.
Client
Graphics -
Vertex Color
by Z Height
This sample demonstrates using client graphics and some other functions that help to support display
control. It uses the currently active part and replaces the part display with a display where the part's color
varies from blue to red where blue is assigned to the lowest Z portion of the part and red is assigned to the
highest Z portion of the part. Areas in between are represented by a smooth blend of color from blue to red.
Client
Graphics -
Line
This sample demonstrates the creation of custom graphics using LineGraphics and LineStripGraphics. The
same set of coordinate data is used for both types of graphics. Line graphics use two coordinates to define
a line, and then the next two coordinates to define the next line, and so on through the defined coordinates.
For the data provided, this results in gaps in the drawn curve. Line strips use the first two coordinates to
define the first line and then the last point of the first line becomes the first point of the second line and the
next coordinate is used as the end point of the second line. This results in the set of points being connected
by a continuous set of lines, drawing a continuous curve. This sample also demonstrates two methods of
defining the color for client graphics. In one case it uses an existing appearance asset, and in the other, it
explicitly defines a color and assigns it. To use the sample you need to have an assembly or part document
open. The program has two behaviors: the first time it is run it will draw the graphics. The second time it is
run it deletes the previously drawn graphics.

ComponentGraphics Object
Derived from: GraphicsPrimitive Object
Description
ComponentGraphics Object.
Methods
Name Description
Delete Method that deletes the graphics primitive.
GetCustomLineType
Method that returns information regarding the custom line type in use.
The method returns a failure if the return value of the LineType property
is not kCustomLineType.
GetTransformBehavior
Method that gets the current transform behavior of the graphic object.
Graphic objects have two special transform behaviors: front facing and
pixel scaling. A front facing object does not rotate as the view is rotated
but maintains the same orientation on the screen. It is positioned at a
specified location within model and its position on the screen will
change as the view is zoomed in and out and scrolled, but its orientation
will not change.
A graphic object that has pixel scaling behavior maintains the same size
relative to the screen. As the user zooms in and out the graphic objects
visible size on the screen will remain the same.
By default an object has no transform behavior, which means its size,
position, and orientation are relative to model space. Text always has
front facing behavior regardless of the behavior type returned through
this method.
GetViewSpaceAnchor
Method that gets the anchor information of the graphics object. This
method returns an error if the 'Anchored' property returns False.
RemoveViewSpaceAnchor
The RemoveViewSpaceAnchor method removes the view space anchor
from the object, and sets the Anchored property to false.
SetCustomLineType
Method that sets a custom line type to the curve from the specified .lin
file. The method automatically changes the value of LineType property
to kCustomLineType.
SetTransformBehavior
Method that sets the transform behavior of the graphic object. Graphic
objects have two special transform behaviors: front facing and pixel
scaling. A front facing object does not rotate as the view is rotated but
maintains the same orientation on the screen. It is positioned at a
specified location within model and its position on the screen will
change as the view is zoomed in and out and scrolled, but its orientation
will not change.

ComponentGraphics.SetTransformBehavior
Method
Parent Object: ComponentGraphics
Description
Method that sets the transform behavior of the graphic object. Graphic objects have two special
transform behaviors: front facing and pixel scaling. A front facing object does not rotate as the view
is rotated but maintains the same orientation on the screen. It is positioned at a specified location
within model and its position on the screen will change as the view is zoomed in and out and scrolled,
but its orientation will not change.
A graphic object that has pixel scaling behavior maintains the same size relative to the screen. As the
user zooms in and out the graphic objects visible size on the screen will remain the same.
Any graphic object can have no transform behavior which means it’s size, position, and orientation
are relative to model space, front facing behavior, pixel scaling behavior, or front facing and pixel
scaling behavior. By default an object has not transform behavior, with the exception of text. Text
always has front facing behavior regardless of the behavior type set through this method.
Syntax
ComponentGraphics.SetTransformBehavior( Anchor As Point, BehaviorType As
DisplayTransformBehaviorEnum, [PixelScale] As Double )
Parameters
Name Type Description
Anchor Point
Input Point object that specifies the anchor point of
the graphic object in model space. The coordinates
of this point are always defined in model
space. The value of this argument is ignored when
setting the behavior type to
kNoTransformBehaviors.
BehaviorType DisplayTransformBehaviorEnum Input value from DisplayTransformBehaviorEnum
that specifies the type of transform behavior the
text has. Valid values are kFrontFacing,
ComponentGraphics Object Page 15 of 17
file:///C:/Users/Cliente/AppData/Local/Temp/~hh6B1.htm 16/06/2025
kFrontFacingAndPixelScaling,
kNoTransformBehaviors, and
kPixelScaling. TextGraphics objects are always
front facing regardless of the defined behavior type.
PixelScale Double
Input Double that defines the scale factor to apply
to all coordinates associated with this graphics
object. This scale factor is only used when the
behavior type is kFrontFacingAndPixelScaling or
kPixelScaling.
This is an optional argument whose default value is
1.0.
Version
Introduced in version 2011

The sample uses and existing part that must be set up to allow it to work correctly. To create the sample part you can use
any part that has a planar face and a linear edge connected to that planar face. A simple box is sufficient. In this part Add a
mate iMate to the planar face and rename the iMate to "Face1". Also add a mate iMate to a linear edge that is on the face
previously named and rename this iMate to "Edge1". Save the part to "C:\Temp\SamplePart.ipt" or any other name and edit
the code below to reference the file. You can then run the sample code which will create a new assembly, insert two
instances of the part and create a rotational connection between them. Then it will animation the rotation by driving the
connection.

Samples
Name Description
SurfaceBody
Copy
This sample demonstrates copying a surface body from one part to another. This is equivalent to the Promote command, but
the API is much more flexible. In order for the sample to be self-contained, it creates two parts on the fly that will be used
to demonstrate copying a body from one part to another. When copying a body into a part, you provide the surface body
and a matrix to define its position in the new part. This sample creates a matrix based on the position of these parts within
an assembly.
Assembly Move
Occurrence
This sample demonstrates moving a component occurrence. This sample performs a translate, but a rotate can also be
performed since the transform is defined using a matrix.

ValueTypeEnum, [Units] As Variant, [Expression] As Variant, [PropertySetId] As Variant,
[PropertyIdentifier] As Variant ) As ContentTableColumn
Parameters
Name Type Description
InternalName String Input String that specifies the internal name of this column.
DisplayHeading String
Input String that specifies the display name of this column.
This is the name of the column that the end-user sees within the
user interface.
DataType ValueTypeEnum
Input value from ValueTypeEnum that specifies the type of
data within this column. Valid values are: kIntegerType,
kDoubleType, kStringType, and kBooleanType.
Units Variant
Input value that specifies the type of unit the values in the
column are. The unit type needs to be specified if the DataType
argument is kIntegerType or kDoubleType. For kStringType
and kBooleanType this argument is ignored.
You specify a unit type using a value from UnitsTypeEnum or
a string that describes a unit. For example, both of the
following are valid unit specifiers for inch: kInchLengthUnits
and "in". String specifiers are typically used for units that are
not defined in the enum list. For example, the volume measure
for cubic inches is not defined in the enum list but you can
specify it using the string "in in in".
This is an optional argument whose default value is null.
Expression Variant
Optional input Variant that specifies the expression to use to
automatically populate the rows of this column. Not supplying
this argument or providing an empty String will result in the
default value of '1' being used.
There are two things that can be defined for the expression, a
standard expression and limits for a custom expression. These
are defined below.
Standard Expression ' This allows you to define an
expression and will evaluate it to populate the rows of the
table. Expressions can contain expression like you would use to
ContentTableColumns Object Page 2 of 6
file:///C:/Users/Cliente/AppData/Local/Temp/~hhA808.htm 16/06/2025
define the value of a parameter and they can also contain the
values of other columns. To use the values of other columns
enclose the internal name within braces. Here are some
examples of valid expression strings.
20 in
{SIZE}
{TOTAL_LENGTH} ' {HEAD_HEIGHT}
{DIA} / 2
Custom Expression Limits' A custom expression allows the
end-user to specify the value when placing the member into an
assembly. You can choose to define the limits for this value,
i.e. minimum, maximum, increment and default values. These
rules are defined using an ExpressionLimits object. You can
create this object using the
ContentTableColumn.CreateExpressionLimits method.
This is an optional argument whose default value is null.
PropertySetId Variant
Optional input String that specifies the name of the property set
that contains the property. This is the InternalName or Name
associated with the property set. If this argument is set you
must also set the PropertyIdentifier argument to fully define the
property to use.
This is an optional argument whose default value is null.
PropertyIdentifier Variant
Optional input Variant that identifies a property. This can be a
Long value that specifies the PropId or the name of a property.
If this argument is set you must also set the PropertySetId
argument to fully define the property to use.
This is an optional argument whose default value is null.

Syntax
ContourFlangeDefinition.GetWidthExtent( Edge As Edge ) As PartFeatureExtent
Parameters
Name Type Description
Edge Edge
The Edge object that identifies the physical contour flange to return the width extent for. The creation of a single
contour flange feature can result in many physical contour flanges being added to the part. Each edge specified for
the contour flange feature wll result in a physical contour flange. The edge specified as input to this argument must
be one of the edges that was specified as input to the contour flange feature and defines which physical contour
flange to return the width extent for.
Remarks
The type of extent object that this property will return can be determined by using the WidthExtentType property. Types that can
be returned are EdgeWidthExtent, WidthWidthExtent, OffsetWidthExtent, and FromToWidthExtent. The extent can be defined by
default width extent of the feature or an override for this particular physical contour flange. You can determine if it is an override
or not by using the GetWidthExtentType property. When the ContourFlangeDefinition object is transient, (created using the
ContourFlangeFeatures.CreateContourFlangeDefinition method or the Copy method of an existing ContourFlangeDefinition
object), this property will return Nothing. The ContourFlangeDefinition still defines the width extent but its details are not
accessible through this property. You can determine the type of width extent by using the WidthExtentType property and can set
the width type using one of the various Set methods. If the contour flange already exists you must roll back the model to the point
just before the contour flange feature was created so that the edge exists in the model and can be used as input to this method.

Parameters
Name Type Description
Path Path Input Path object that specifies the shape of the contour flange.
Edges Variant
Optional input Object that specifies the edge(s) to create a contour flange feature on. This can be either
an Edge object or an EdgeCollection containing at least one Edge object. If all of the edges of a Face
are desired, it is up to you to obtain them from the Face and add them to the collection.
Edges are not needed when a contour flange is created using a distance extent and this argument can be
omitted in that case. You will need to call the SetDistanceExtent method to set the distance.
This is an optional argument whose default value is null.
Remarks
The object created does not represent a contour flange feature but instead is a representation of the information that
defines a contour flange feature. You can use this object as input to the CoutnourFlangeFeatures.Add method to create
the actual contour flange feature. The ContourFlangeDefinition object returned is fully defined and can be used to
create a contour flange feature. However, defaults are used for most of the contour flange options so you may want to
change some of the property values of the ContourFlangeDefinition object before using it to create a contour flange
feature.

PixelScale Double
Output Double that returns the scale factor to
apply to all coordinates associated with this
graphics object. The scale factor is only relevant
when the object has pixel scaling behavior.
Remarks
Graphic objects have two special transform behaviors: front facing and pixel scaling. A front
facing object does not rotate as the view is rotated but maintains the same orientation on the
screen. It is positioned at a specified location within model and its position on the screen will
change as the view is zoomed in and out and scrolled, but its orientation will not change. A
graphic object that has pixel scaling behavior maintains the same size relative to the screen. As the
user zooms in and out the graphic objects visible size on the screen will remain the same. By
default an object has no transform behavior, which means its size, position, and orientation are
relative to model space. Text always has front facing behavior regardless of the behavior type
returned through this method.

Syntax
CurveGraphics.SetTransformBehavior( Anchor As Point, BehaviorType As
DisplayTransformBehaviorEnum, [PixelScale] As Double )
Parameters
Name Type Description
Anchor Point
Input Point object that specifies the anchor point
of the graphic object in model space. The
coordinates of this point are always defined in
model space. The value of this argument is
ignored when setting the behavior type to
kNoTransformBehaviors.
BehaviorType DisplayTransformBehaviorEnum
Input value from
DisplayTransformBehaviorEnum that specifies
the type of transform behavior the text has.
Valid values are kFrontFacing,
kFrontFacingAndPixelScaling,
kNoTransformBehaviors, and kPixelScaling.
TextGraphics objects are always front facing
regardless of the defined behavior type.
PixelScale Double
Input Double that defines the scale factor to
apply to all coordinates associated with this
graphics object. This scale factor is only used
when the behavior type is
kFrontFacingAndPixelScaling or kPixelScaling.
This is an optional argument whose default
value is 1.0.
Remarks
Graphic objects have two special transform behaviors: front facing and pixel scaling. A front
facing object does not rotate as the view is rotated but maintains the same orientation on the
screen. It is positioned at a specified location within model and its position on the screen will
change as the view is zoomed in and out and scrolled, but its orientation will not change. A
graphic object that has pixel scaling behavior maintains the same size relative to the screen. As the
user zooms in and out the graphic objects visible size on the screen will remain the same. Any
graphic object can have no transform behavior which means it's size, position, and orientation are
relative to model space, front facing behavior, pixel scaling behavior, or front facing and pixel
scaling behavior. By default an object has not transform behavior, with the exception of text. Text
always has front facing behavior regardless of the behavior type set through this method.
