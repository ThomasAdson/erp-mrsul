Methods
Name Description
CalculateFacets Obtain the facetted representation for the given chord-height tolerance.
CalculateFacetsAndTextureMap Obtain the facetted representation for the given chord-height tolerance. This also include the texture map coordinates.
CalculateFacetsWithOptions Method that creates a new set of facets within the specified conditions.
CalculateStrokes Obtain the stroked or polygonal representation for the given chord-height tolerance.
CalculateStrokesWithOptions Method that creates a new set of strokes within the specified conditions.
GetClosestPointTo
Method that returns a point on the face that is closest to the input point. A single point is returned even if multiple
equidistant points are found. To get the u-v parameters of the returned point on the face, use
Face.Evaluator.GetParamAtPoint method.
GetExistingFacets
Obtain the facetted representation for the given chord-height tolerance as. Fails if the tolerance supplied is not preexisting.
GetExistingFacetsAndTextureMap
Method that returns the specified set of existing display facets. Existing display facets are stored to single-precision
floating point accuracy. This is typically adequate accuracy for display purposes. If a more accurate result is required you
can use the CalculateFacets method which will calculate new facets to a given tolerance at double-precision accuracy.
GetExistingFacetTolerances
Method that gets the tolerances that were used to calculate the existing sets of display facets. These can be used to
determine if any existing facets have been calculated within your desired accuracy. The tolerance value is also used as an
index to specify which set of existing facets to retrieve when using the GetExistingFacets method. If you are using this
method within Apprentice, you can use the DisplayAffinity property to optimize Apprentice for access to facets. Setting
this property to True before you begin to traverse an assembly notifies Apprentice not to load any B-rep entities.
GetExistingStrokes
Method that returns the specified set of strokes from the SurfaceBody, Face or Edge the method was called from.
Existing strokes are stored to single-precision floating point accuracy. This is typically adequate accuracy for display
purposes. If a more accurate result is required you can use the CalculateStrokes method, which will calculate new strokes
to a given tolerance at double-precision accuracy. If you are using this method within Apprentice, you can use the
DisplayAffinity property to optimize Apprentice for access to strokes. Setting this property to True before you begin to
traverse an assembly notifies Apprentice not to load any B-rep entities.
GetExistingStrokeTolerances
Method that gets the tolerances that were used to calculate the existing sets of display strokes. These can be used to
determine if any existing strokes have been calculated within your desired accuracy. The tolerance value is also used as

Description
Obtain the facetted representation for the given chord-height tolerance.
Syntax
Face.CalculateFacets( Tolerance As Double, VertexCount As Long, FacetCount As Long, VertexCoordinates() As Double, NormalVectors() As Double,
VertexIndices() As Long )
Parameters
Name Type Description
Tolerance Double
Input Double that specifies the maximum distance that the facet can deviate from the smooth surface. This value is in
centimeters. Smaller values can result in a much greater number of facets being returned and will require more processing time to
calculate.
The picture below illustrates how the chordal tolerance is used when creating a stroked version of a curve. The chordal tolerance
defines the maximum distance a line can be from the actual curve. When calculating facets the same concept applies but it
defines the maximum distance between a triangle facet and the smooth surface.

The pictures below illustrate the difference obtained when calculating facets for a model using different chordal tolerances. The
overall size of this model is approx. 6x6x4 cm’s. The picture on the left used a chordal tolerance of 0.1 cm and the one on the
right used a tolerance of 0.01 cm.
VertexCount Long
Output Long that returns the number of vertices that were generated. This is the number of vertices that will be returned by the
VertexCoordinates argument.
FacetCount Long Output Long that returns the number of facets that were generated.
VertexCoordinates Double
Output array of Doubles that contains the coordinate locations of the vertices. The values are defined in x, y, z order within the
array and represent coordinates within the model space of the faceted object.
NormalVectors Double
Output array of Doubles that defines the normal for each vertex in the facet mesh. The values are defined in x, y, z order within
the array and represent vector components within the model space of the faceted object.
VertexIndices Long
Output array of Longs that are used as index values to index into the vertex coordinate list. The first coordinate in the vertex
coordinate list is index 1. Using vertex indices allows vertex coordinates to be reused by more than one triangle, thus reducing the
overall resources required to define the entire mesh.

Face.GetExistingStrokeTolerances Method
Parent Object: Face
Description
Face Object Page 13 of 20
file:///C:/Users/Cliente/AppData/Local/Temp/~hh7693.htm 16/06/2025
Method that gets the tolerances that were used to calculate the existing sets of display strokes. These can be used to determine if any existing strokes have
been calculated within your desired accuracy. The tolerance value is also used as an index to specify which set of existing strokes to retrieve when using the
GetExistingStrokes method. If you are using this method within Apprentice, you can use the DisplayAffinity property to optimize Apprentice for access to
strokes. Setting this property to True before you begin to traverse an assembly notifies Apprentice not to load any B-rep entities.
Syntax
Face.GetExistingStrokeTolerances( ToleranceCount As Long, ExistingTolerances() As Double )

KeyContext Long
Input Long that specifies the key context. The key context must be supplied when working with any B-Rep entities (and SurfaceBody,
FaceShell, Face, Edge, EdgeUse and Vertex objects). A key context is created using the CreateKeyContext method of the
ReferenceKeyManager object. For all other object types, the key context argument is not used and is ignored if provided.
This is an optional argument whose default value is 0.
Remarks
The reference key is an array of bytes that can be used as a persistent reference for this entity. To obtain the entity at a later time using the reference key you
use the BindKeyToObject method of the object. The ReferenceKeyManager object is obtained using the ReferenceKeyManager property of the Document
object.

file:///C:/Users/Cliente/AppData/Local/Temp/~hhA71.htm 16/06/2025
Syntax
FaceProxy.CalculateFacets( Tolerance As Double, VertexCount As Long, FacetCount As Long, VertexCoordinates() As Double, NormalVectors() As
Double, VertexIndices() As Long )
Parameters
Name Type Description
Tolerance Double
Input Double that specifies the maximum distance that the facet can deviate from the smooth surface. This value is in
centimeters. Smaller values can result in a much greater number of facets being returned and will require more processing time to
calculate.
The picture below illustrates how the chordal tolerance is used when creating a stroked version of a curve. The chordal tolerance
defines the maximum distance a line can be from the actual curve. When calculating facets the same concept applies but it
defines the maximum distance between a triangle facet and the smooth surface.
The pictures below illustrate the difference obtained when calculating facets for a model using different chordal tolerances. The
overall size of this model is approx. 6x6x4 cm’s. The picture on the left used a chordal tolerance of 0.1 cm and the one on the
right used a tolerance of 0.01 cm.
VertexCount Long
Output Long that returns the number of vertices that were generated. This is the number of vertices that will be returned by the
VertexCoordinates argument.
FacetCount Long Output Long that returns the number of facets that were generated.
VertexCoordinates Double
Output array of Doubles that contains the coordinate locations of the vertices. The values are defined in x, y, z order within the
array and represent coordinates within the model space of the faceted object.
NormalVectors Double
Output array of Doubles that defines the normal for each vertex in the facet mesh. The values are defined in x, y, z order within
the array and represent vector components within the model space of the faceted object.
VertexIndices Long
Output array of Longs that are used as index values to index into the vertex coordinate list. The first coordinate in the vertex
coordinate list is index 1. Using vertex indices allows vertex coordinates to be reused by more than one triangle, thus reducing the
overall resources required to define the entire mesh.

Property Value
This is a read only property whose value is a ContainmentEnum.
Parameters
Name Type Description
Point Double Point whose location to determine.
UseBox Boolean Optional input Boolean that specifies whether to use a box to determine if the
point is inside, on or outside of the body. Sometimes one wants to avoid the
creation of bounding boxes during intermediate steps of a construction because
the creation of bounding boxes can be costly. If you're applying multiple
operations to a body then the bounding box of some of the shells would be
invalid after each operation. You wouldn't want to use the bounding box during
these intermediate stages because you might spend more time computing the
bounding box than you'd save by using it for trivial rejection. On the other
FaceShell Object Page 5 of 9
file:///C:/Users/Cliente/AppData/Local/Temp/~hh4D47.htm 16/06/2025
hand, if you have a stable body and a high likelihood that the bounding box is
up-to-date, then it might save some time to set the use_box parameter to true.
This is an optional argument whose default value is True.

Parameters
Name Type Description
Point Double Point whose location to determine.
UseBox Boolean
Optional input Boolean that specifies whether to use a box to determine if the
point is inside, on or outside of the body. Sometimes one wants to avoid the
creation of bounding boxes during intermediate steps of a construction because
the creation of bounding boxes can be costly. If you're applying multiple
operations to a body then the bounding box of some of the shells would be
invalid after each operation. You wouldn't want to use the bounding box during
these intermediate stages because you might spend more time computing the
bounding box than you'd save by using it for trivial rejection. On the other
hand, if you have a stable body and a high likelihood that the bounding box is
up-to-date, then it might save some time to set the use_box parameter to true.
This is an optional argument whose default value is True.

NameValueMap, FullFileName As String, HandlingCode As HandlingCodeEnum )
Parameters
Name Type Description
RelativeFileName String
Input the relative filename of the document. This is
typically just the filename but may also include
relative path information. Inventor uses this in
combination with the paths defined by the active
project to resolve the location of the file.
LibraryName String
Input string value that indicates the library name if
necessary.
CustomLogicalName Byte
FileAccessEvents Object Page 2 of 10
file:///C:/Users/Cliente/AppData/Local/Temp/~hh7F84.htm 16/06/2025
Input an array of Bytes that is used by data
management systems as a way to associate additional
information with a file reference. In the case where a
custom logical name was assigned to a reference and
the associated document, this argument will return
that value. The data management application that
originally defined the custom logical name can use
this information to help look up the file within the
data management system.
BeforeOrAfter EventTimingEnum
Input EventTimingEnum indicating when the event is
being fired. This notification is currently only
provided before the document is resolved.
Context NameValueMap
Input NameValueMap object that can be used to
determine the context of why the event fired.
Additional information is provided through this
argument to help in understanding the context of the
notification. Name = "DatabaseRevisionId". Value =
This value should be ignored. Name =
"InternalName". Value = The internal name of the
document that was last resolved for this reference.
This is the same value returned by the InternalName
property of the document that was last used for this
reference. Name = "DirectReferencingFileName".
Value = This value and the value for
TopLevelFilename are related. Looking at a simple
example helps to explain the information they
provide: In this example there is Part.ipt that's
referenced by subassembly Sub.iam, which is
referenced by the assembly Top.iam. When you open
Top.iam, the other files also need to be resolved and
loaded. When Top.iam is opened, an
OnFileResolution notification is sent for Sub.iam. For
Sub.iam, DirectReferencingFileName will be the full
filename of Top.iam because Sub.iam is being loaded
because of the direct reference from Top.iam.
TopLevelFilename will also be the full filename of
Top.iam since that is the top level document that was
opened. An OnFileResolution notification is also sent
for Part.ipt. In this case, DirectReferencingFileName
will be the full filename of Sub.iam since Part.ipt is
being loaded because of the direct reference from
Sub.iam. TopLevelFilename will be the full filename
of Top.iam, since is it the top-level document that
caused the loading. Name = "TopLevelFilename".
Value = See the description for
DirectReferencingFileName.
FullFileName String
Input string that indicates the full filename of the
document you want Inventor to load.
HandlingCode HandlingCodeEnum Input HandlingCodeEnum that indicates how you
want the client to hande the event. To handle this
event and you need to set this argument to
kEventHandled. This will cause Inventor to skip its
FileAccessEvents Object Page 3 of 10
file:///C:/Users/Cliente/AppData/Local/Temp/~hh7F84.htm 16/06/2025
standard resolution and load the file you spescified in
the FullFileName argument. Setting the value of this
argument to kEventNotHandled (the default) will
cause Inventor to use its standard file resolution.
Canceling this event is not supported and setting this
argument to kEventCanceled has the same effect as
kEventNotHandled.

FileAccessEvents.OnFileDirty( RelativeFileName As String, LibraryName As String,
CustomLogicalName() As Byte, FullFileName As String, DocumentObject As Document,
BeforeOrAfter As EventTimingEnum, Context As NameValueMap, HandlingCode As
HandlingCodeEnum )
Parameters
Name Type Description
RelativeFileName String
The relative filename of the document. This is
typically just the filename but may also include
relative path information.
LibraryName String
If the document is a library part, this argument
provides the name of the library as defined in the
active project. If it is not a library part this will be an
empty string.
CustomLogicalName Byte
An array of Bytes that is used by data management
systems as a way to associated additional information
with a file reference. In the case where a custom
logical name was assigned to a reference and the
associated document, this argument will return that
value.
FullFileName String The full filename of the document.
DocumentObject Document Input object being dirtied.
BeforeOrAfter EventTimingEnum
FileAccessEvents Object Page 4 of 10
file:///C:/Users/Cliente/AppData/Local/Temp/~hh7F84.htm 16/06/2025
Input EventTimingEnum indicating when the event is
being fired. This notification is currently only
provided before the document is dirtied so this is
always kBefore.
Context NameValueMap
Input NameValueMap object that can be used to
determine the context of why the event fired.
Additional information is provided through this
argument to help in understanding the context of the
notification.
Name = "AffectedFiles". Value = An array of Strings
that contains a list of full filenames of the files being
dirtied. Typically this will contain a single filename,
but in the case of referenced files, changing one
document can also cause others to become dirty. For
example, editing a part in the context of the assembly
can cause other parts to reposition within other
assemblies and in the case of adaptivity can cause
parts to update. Each of these documents becomes
dirty as a result of editing the single part. This list
returns the filenames of the files affected. An
OnFileDirty event notification is also made for each
document as it is dirtied.
Name = "ReasonsForChange". Value = A value from
the CommandTypesEnum list, which represents the
different categories of changes that can be made.
Typically this will be a single value from the list but it
can represent multiple values that have been combined
together so you need to use bitwise operations to
check for a specific change.
Name = "Reason". Value = Returns "Update" or
"FilesOpened" indicating the dirty reason.
Name = "DirtyByRecompute". Value = A Boolean
value indicates if the dirty is caused by recompute
only.
HandlingCode HandlingCodeEnum
Output HandlingCodeEnum that indicates how you
are handling the event. This event supports the ability
to cancel the dirty by aborting the actions that caused
the change. By setting this argument to
kEventCanceled Inventor will abort the change.
Remarks
A document becomes dirty when a change is made to a clean document. A clean document is
defined as a document that has not changed since it was last saved. Examples of clean documents
are documents that have just been opened and documents that have just been saved. In both cases,
a save operation is not needed because the file on disk is the same as the open document. Any
change to the open document causes it to be different than the version on disk. When the
FileAccessEvents Object Page 5 of 10
file:///C:/Users/Cliente/AppData/Local/Temp/~hh7F84.htm 16/06/2025
document changes state of going from clean to dirty this notification is sent. Any subsequent
changes to the document do not result in the OnFileDirty notification being sent because the
document is already dirty. If the document is saved it will become clean, (the in-memory version
of the document matches the version on disk), and the next change will again cause the
OnFileDirty event notification to be made. Some of the actions that cause a document to become
dirty can be controlled through the Save tab of the Application Options dialog and will impact
when this notification is sent.

RelativeFileName String
The relative filename of the document. This is
typically just the filename but may also include
relative path information. Inventor uses this in
combination with the paths defined by the active
project to resolve the location of the file.
LibraryName String
If the document is a library part, this argument
provides the name of the library as defined in the
active project. If it is not a library part this will be an
empty string.
CustomLogicalName Byte An array of Bytes that is used by data management
systems as a way to associate additional information
with a file reference. In the case where a custom
logical name was assigned to a reference and the
associated document, this argument will return that
value. The data management application that
originally defined the custom logical name can use
FileAccessEvents Object Page 6 of 10
file:///C:/Users/Cliente/AppData/Local/Temp/~hh7F84.htm 16/06/2025
this information to help look up the file within the
data management system.
BeforeOrAfter EventTimingEnum
Input EventTimingEnum indicating when the event is
being fired. This notification is always provided with
kBefore when the document is being resolved, and
only provided kAfter when this event is not handled in
kBefore.
Context NameValueMap Input NameValueMap object that can be used to
determine the context of why the event fired.
Additional information is provided through this
argument to help in understanding the context of the
notification.
Name = "DatabaseRevisionId". Value = This value
should be ignored.
Name = "InternalName". Value = The internal name
of the document that was last resolved for this
reference. This is the same value returned by the
InternalName property of the document that was last
used for this reference.
Name = "DirectReferencingFileName". Value = This
value and the value for TopLevelFilename are related.
Looking at a simple example helps to explain the
information they provide: In this example there is
Part.ipt that's referenced by subassembly Sub.iam,
which is referenced by the assembly Top.iam. When
you open Top.iam, the other files also need to be
resolved and loaded. When Top.iam is opened, an
OnFileResolution notification is sent for Sub.iam. For
Sub.iam, DirectReferencingFileName will be the full
filename of Top.iam because Sub.iam is being loaded
because of the direct reference from Top.iam.
TopLevelFilename will also be the full filename of
Top.iam since that is the top level document that was
opened. An OnFileResolution notification is also sent
for Part.ipt. In this case, DirectReferencingFileName
will be the full filename of Sub.iam since Part.ipt is
being loaded because of the direct reference from
Sub.iam. TopLevelFilename will be the full filename
of Top.iam, since is it the top-level document that

Name = "TopLevelFilename". Value = See the
description for DirectReferencingFileName.
Name = "IsForeignFile". Value = Boolean value that
indicates whether the file being resolved is a foreign
file.
Name = "RedirectionStreamIndex ". Value = Long
value that indicates the redirection stream index of the
file for native and foreign files respectively. This
value is starting from 0.
FullFileName String
If you are handling this event you use this argument to
pass back the full filename of the document you want
Inventor to load.
HandlingCode HandlingCodeEnum
Output HandlingCodeEnum that indicates how you
are handling the event. To handle this event and you
need to set this argument to kEventHandled. This will
cause Inventor to skip its standard resolution and load
the file you spescified in the FullFileName argument.
Setting the value of this argument to
kEventNotHandled (the default) will cause Inventor to
use its standard file resolution. Canceling this event is
not supported and setting this argument to
kEventCanceled has the same effect as
kEventNotHandled.
Remarks
Whenever a document is opened in Inventor that contains references to other documents, the paths
to the referenced documents must be determined. This process referred to as "file resolution". For
example, if there is an assembly Top.iam that contains Part.ipt, when Top.iam is opened Inventor
needs to find Part.ipt on the disk in order to open it too. It does this using a combination of
information stored in Top.iam and the paths defined by the active project. This event allows you to
override Inventors standard file resolution and perform the resolution yourself. The
OnFileResolution event notification is sent at the time Inventor recognizes that a file needs to be
resolved but before it begins the resolution process. Through the arguments of this event, Inventor
provides you all of the information it has about this reference. You can use this information to
perform your own file resolution using whatever logic you choose and then supply Inventor with
the full filename to use. If you supply a valid filename Inventor skips its resolution and loads the
file you specify. The intent of this event is to allow you to control how Inventor resolves files. It is
not intended as a mechanism to replace parts in an assembly. The filename you provide should be
the full path of the original file that was referenced.

FileDialog Object
Description
The FileDialog object represents the Inventor dialogs that are displayed when the user invokes the
Place Component or Save As command. In the API, the FileDialog object provides the ability to
use these same dialogs when a filename is needed from the user. It is very similar in concept to the
Microsoft common file control.
Methods
Name Description
SetHelpContext
Method that sets the HTML Help Context to display when the help button is
pressed in the FileDialog.
SetHelpTopic
Method that sets the HTML Help Topic to display when the help button is
pressed in the FileDialog.
ShowOpen
Method that displays the open dialog. The existence of the specified file is
checked for by the dialog, so only valid filenames will be returned. This does not
actually open the file but only returns the filename the user has specified through
the dialog.
ShowSave
Method that displays the Save As dialog. If the user selects an existing file a
warning message is displayed notifying them that the file already exists and the
file will be overwritten if they continue. The use of this method does not actually
perform a save but only returns the filename the user has specified through the
dialog.
Properties
Name Description
CancelError Generate error when user cancels dialog if true.
DialogTitle The string displayed in the dialog's title bar.
FileDialogEvents Property that returns the FileDialogEvents object.
FileName
The selected filename. Can be pre-set to initialize the selected
filename in the dialog.
Filter The filter used to limit the types of files displayed in the dialog.
FilterIndex The index of the default filter in the filter string (first index is 1).
InitialDirectory
The initial directory displayed in the file dialog. This can also be
set with the filename property.
InsertMode
Gets and sets whether the FileDialog is being used for inserting a
file (as opposed to opening one). If set to True, the
OnFileInsertDialog event is fired by the ShowOpen method; if set
to False, the OnFileOpenDialog event is fired. This defaults to True
when a FileDialog is created.
MultiSelectEnabled Gets and sets whether the 'Open' dialog should allow the selection
of multiple files. If multiple files are selected by the user, the
FileDialog Object Page 1 of 12
file:///C:/Users/Cliente/AppData/Local/Temp/~hhCB81.htm 16/06/2025
FileName property returns a string containing all selected file
names delimited by a vertical bar ('|').
OptionsEnabled
Gets and sets whether the 'Options' button on the dialog is enabled.
If the button is enabled and the user clicks it, the OnOptions event
is fired.
OptionValues
Read-only property that returns the settings the user specified in the
options dialog when a file type known to Inventor was selected.
This includes the standard Inventor types (.ipt, .iam, .idw, etc.) and
also any files types supported by any translator add-ins. In the case
where it’s an unknown type (i.e. .txt, .xml), or if no options were
specified this property will return Nothing.
The NameValueMap that’s returned can be used directly as the
NameValueMap for the corresponding translator add-in.
ShowQuickLaunch
Gets and sets whether the quick launch controls on the dialog are
visible or not. When the dialog is in insert mode the quick launch
controls will be always hidden, so to show the quick launch
controls the InsertMode should be set to False also.
SuppressResolutionWarnings
Specifies whether or not to warn that a file is being saved outside
of a project resolvable location.

Events
Name Description
OnFileInsertDialog
The OnFileInsertDialog event notifies a client whenever the end-user
has executed a command that provides for the selection and insertion of
a document into another document.
OnFileInsertNewDialog
The OnFileInsertNewDialog event notifies the client whenever the enduser
executes the Create Component command within an assembly.
OnFileNew Fires before a File New from standard template is executed.
OnFileNewDialog
The OnFileNewDialog event notifies the client when the end-user
executes the New or Create Drawing View command to create a new
file.
OnFileOpenDialog
The OnFileOpenDialog event notifies the client when the end-user
executes the Open command to open an existing file. By responding to
this event the client can override Inventor's standard behavior of
displaying the Open dialog and provide their own interface to determine
the file to open. This notification is only made in cases where the Open
dialog is displayed to allow the end-user to select a file. If the end-user
uses the most recently used list in the File menu to open a file the Open
dialog is bypassed and the file is opened directly and because the Open
dialog is not used this notification is not sent.
OnFileOpenFromMRU Fires when a file is selected from the MRU list to open.

FileUIEvents.OnFileInsertDialog Event
Parent Object: FileUIEvents
Description
The OnFileInsertDialog event notifies a client whenever the end-user has executed a command
that provides for the selection and insertion of a document into another document.
FileUIEvents Object Page 2 of 17
file:///C:/Users/Cliente/AppData/Local/Temp/~hhD763.htm 16/06/2025
Syntax
FileUIEvents.OnFileInsertDialog( FileTypes() As String, DocumentObject As Document,
ParentHWND As Long, FileName As String, RelativeFileName As String, LibraryName As
String, CustomLogicalName() As Byte, Context As NameValueMap, HandlingCode As
HandlingCodeEnum )
Parameters
Name Type Description
FileTypes String
A list of the file types displayed in the 'Files of Type'
combo box on the Open dialog. For example, when
the Derived Component command is executed the
array contains the following three strings:
"Component Files (*.ipt, *.iam)|*.ipt; *.iam" "Part
Files (*.ipt)|*.ipt" "Assembly Files (*.iam)|*.iam"
DocumentObject Document
The object the file will be inserted into. For example,
if the Place Component command is invoked, this will
be the assembly the component will be inserted into.
ParentHWND Long
The Windows handle of the Inventor Application
window. If the client displays their own dialog they
can use this to associate their dialog to the Inventor
window. This results in better behavior between the
client dialog and Inventor. For example, the client
window will stay on top of Inventor and if the
Inventor window is collapsed the client dialog will
also be collapsed.
FileName String
The full filename that the client returns to Inventor if
they choose to override Inventor's standard behavior
and obtain the filename themselves. In order for this
filename to be used the client must also return
kEventHandled as the handling code.
Multiple files are also supported where the file names
are delimited with the "|" character. For example:
FileName =
"C:\Temp\Part1.ipt|C:\Temp\Part2.ipt"
RelativeFileName String Not used.
LibraryName String Not used.
CustomLogicalName Byte
FileUIEvents Object Page 3 of 17
file:///C:/Users/Cliente/AppData/Local/Temp/~hhD763.htm 16/06/2025
An array of Bytes that can be used by data
management systems as a way to associate additional
information with a file reference. During file
resolution, the data management system can use this
information to help look up the file within the data
management system. Supplying an array of bytes for
this event will associate this custom logical name with
the reference created to the document being inserted.
If a reference already exists for this document, the
existing custom logical name will be replaced by this
one.
Context NameValueMap
Input object that can be used to determine the context
of why the event fired. Additional information is
provided through this argument to help in
understanding the context of the notification. See the
Remarks section for valid NameValueMap values.
HandlingCode HandlingCodeEnum
Output that indicates how you are handling the
event. The following three values are supportd:
• kEventNotHandled: Inventor continues with its
standard behavior and displays the Open dialog
to allow the end-user to select a file.
• kEventHandled: Indicates that the client is
handling getting the filename. Requires that the
client also sets the FileName argument with the
full filename of the file Inventor should use.
• kEventCanceled: Cancels the operation.
Remarks
Three common commands are the Place Component command in assembly, the Derived
Component command in part, and the Base View command in drawing. When these commands
are run, the end-user needs to select a file. By default Inventor displays the standard Open dialog
to allow them to specify the file. Using this event a client can override the standard behavior of
Inventor and provide the filename using whatever procedure they choose; typically replacing the
Open dialog with their own dialog. This notification is sent to the client at the point the Open
dialog would usually be displayed. If the client wants to handle getting the filename then they get
a filename any way they choose and then respond to this event by setting the FileName argument
with the filename they have and set the HandlingCode argument to kEventHandled. If the client
responds to this event with a filename and the kEventHandled, then Inventor uses the supplied
filename and does not display its standard Open dialog. If the client responds with
kEventNotHandled, Inventor uses its standard behavior and will display the Open dialog. If the
FileUIEvents Object Page 4 of 17
file:///C:/Users/Cliente/AppData/Local/Temp/~hhD763.htm 16/06/2025
client responds with kEventCanceled, the command is cancelled. Valid NameValueMap values for
the Context argument:
Name Value Valid when inserting
Embed Boolean .xls, .xlsx, all image files
DesignViewRepresentation String .iam

FileUIEvents.OnFileInsertNewDialog Event
Parent Object: FileUIEvents
Description
The OnFileInsertNewDialog event notifies the client whenever the end-user executes the Create
Component command within an assembly.
Syntax
FileUIEvents.OnFileInsertNewDialog( TemplateDir As String, FileTypes() As String,
DocumentObject As Document, ParentHWND As Long, TemplateFileName As String,
FileName As String, RelativeFileName As String, LibraryName As String, CustomLogicalName
() As Byte, Context As NameValueMap, HandlingCode As HandlingCodeEnum )
Parameters
Name Type Description
TemplateDir String
The default template directory as defined in the File
tab of the Application Options dialog. This
information can be used by the client in their dialog to
allow the end-user to select one of the standard
templates.
FileTypes String A list of the file types displayed in the "Files of Type"
combo box on the Open dialog. For example, when
the Derived Component command is executed the
FileUIEvents Object Page 5 of 17
file:///C:/Users/Cliente/AppData/Local/Temp/~hhD763.htm 16/06/2025
array contains the following strings: "Part Files (*.ipt)
|*.ipt" "Assembly Files (*.iam)|*.iam"
DocumentObject Document
The AssemblyDocument object the new component
will be created within.
ParentHWND Long
The Windows handle of the Inventor Application
window. If the client displays their own dialog they
can use this to associate their dialog to the Inventor
window. This results in better behavior between the
client dialog and Inventor. For example, the client
window will stay on top of Inventor and if the
Inventor window is collapsed the client dialog will
also be collapsed.
TemplateFileName String
The full filename of the file to use as the template
when creating the new component. This can be any
existing file and is not restricted to the files within the
default template path. If this argument is not set, then
the default part or assembly template will be used for
the component. The type of document is determined
based on the extension of the filename supplied in the
Filename argument. This argument is ignored unless
the HandlingCode argument is set to kEventHandled.
FileName String
The full filename of the file to be created. When
creating a component in-place, the component is
created in memory and is not written to disk until the
end-user performs a save of the file. Because the
filename is specified during the creation of the
component the end-user will not be prompted for a
filename during the save operation. This argument is
required if the HandlingCode is set to kEventHandled.
RelativeFileName String Not used.
LibraryName String Not used.
CustomLogicalName Byte
An array of Bytes that could have been defined by an
application as an additional identifier for this
document.
Context NameValueMap
Input object that can be used to determine the context
of why the event fired. No context information is
provided for this event. See Remarks for valid
NameValueMap values.
HandlingCode HandlingCodeEnum Output that indicates how you are handling the event.
This can supply any of the following three values\: *
kEventNotHandled\: Inventor continues with its
standard behavior and displays the "Create In-Place
Component" dialog to allow the end-user to specify
the component information. * kEventHandled\:
Indicates that the client is handling getting the
FileUIEvents Object Page 6 of 17
file:///C:/Users/Cliente/AppData/Local/Temp/~hhD763.htm 16/06/2025
component information. Requires that the client also
set, at least, the FileName argument with the full
filename of the component to be created. *
kEventCanceled\: Cancels the operation.
Remarks
By responding to this event the client can replace the 'Create In-Place Component' dialog with
their own. This notification is sent to the client immediately after the command is executed but
before the standard dialog is displayed to the end-user. By supplying at least the Filename
argument and setting the HandlingCode to kEventHandled, Inventor will bypass displaying the
standard dialog and use the information provided to create a new in-place component within the
assembly. The rest of the command behavior remains the same. That is, if this isn't the first
component being placed in the assembly, the end-user must select a location in the assembly to
position the new component. Valid NameValueMap values for the Context parameter:
Name Value Comments
BOMStructure BOMStructureEnum
VirtualComponent Boolean
The FileName argument is the virtual component
name.
ConstrainSketchPlane Boolean Does not apply for the first component in assembly.

Parameters
Name Type Description
Edge Edge
The Edge object that identifies the physical flange to return the width extent for. The creation of a
single flange feature can result in many physical flanges being added to the part. Each edge
specified for the flange feature wll result in a physical flange. The edge specified as input to this
argument must be one of the edges that was specified as input to the flange feature and defines
which physical flange to return the width extent for.
Remarks
The type of extent object that this property will return can be determined by using the WidthExtentType property.
Types that can be returned are EdgeWidthExtent, WidthWidthExtent, OffsetWidthExtent, and
FromToWidthExtent. The extent can be defined by default width extent of the feature or an override for this
particular physical flange. You can determine if it is an override or not by using the GetWidthExtentType
property. When the FlangeDefinition object is transient, (created using the FlangeFeatures.
CreateFlangeDefinition method or the Copy method of an existing FlangeDefinition object), this property will
return Nothing. The FlangeDefinition still defines the width extent but its details are not accessible through this
property. You can determine the type of width extent by using the WidthExtentType property and can set the
width type using one of the various Set methods.

Input array of SelelctionFilterEnum values that indicate the type of objects to find. The
values are the enum values from the SelectionFilterEnum and can be combined to specify
multiple object types.
ProximityTolerance Variant
Input Double that specifies the tolerance value for the search. This value defines the radius of
a sphere at the input point. All objects that intersect this sphere will be returned. If not
specified, the default internal tolerance is used.
This is an optional argument whose default value is null.

Syntax
FlatPattern.FindUsingRay( RayStartPoint As Point, RayDirection As UnitVector, Radius As Double, FoundEntities As
ObjectsEnumerator, LocationPoints As ObjectsEnumerator, [FindFirstOnly] As Boolean )
Parameters
Name Type Description
FlatPattern Object Page 10 of 26
file:///C:/Users/Cliente/AppData/Local/Temp/~hhFAB6.htm 16/06/2025
RayStartPoint Point Input Point object that defines the start point of the ray in model space.
RayDirection UnitVector
Input UnitVector object that defines the direction of the ray. The ray is infinite in the direction
defined.
Radius Double
Input Double that defines the radius of the ray. This value is specified in centimeters. Defining a
radius for a ray allows the intersection to be within a given tolerance. This radius essentially results
in the definition of a cylinder whose axis lies along the axis defined by the RayStartPoint and
RayDirection. The intersection result is between the cylinder and the model's entities. A value
higher than zero is recommended, though not explicitly required.
FoundEntities ObjectsEnumerator Output ObjectsEnumerator that returns the entities that were intersected by the ray.
LocationPoints ObjectsEnumerator
Output ObjectsEnumerator that returns a set of Point objects. One Point object is returned for each
entity in the FoundEntities list. The point defines the coordinate of the intersection between the ray
and the corresponding entity.
FindFirstOnly Boolean
Optional input Boolean that specifies whether to find just the first entity in the ray's path. If False
(the default) then all entities found are returned.
This is an optional argument whose default value is False.
Remarks
There is also a precedence in the type of entities returned. The entities returned can be Vertex, Edge, or Face objects. The precedence is
in that order. If the ray intersects a vertex, then that vertex is returned and none of the edges or faces that connect to that vertex are
returned. If the ray intersects an edge, then that edge is returned and none of the faces that connect to the edge are returned. If the ray
intersects a face, then that face is returned. If desired, you can use the functionality provided by the B-Rep portion of the API to obtain
the various associated objects from the entity returned. For example if you need a face but an edge is returned, you can use the Faces
property of the Edge object to get the associated faces. The start point defines the physical starting point from which to determine
intersections. Any intersections behind the start point are ignored. However, the ray is infinite from the start point, so all intersections in
the direction of the ray will be returned. Note: As of Autodesk Inventor 5.3 Service Pack 2, the FindUsingRay method has superseded
LocateUsingRay. Please update your applications accordingly.

Direction UnitVector
Input UnitVector that defines direction to find all entities that the vector penetrates. The
vector is treated as infinite in both directions from the origin point so all entities that lie in
the path of the vector on either side of the origin point will be returned.
ObjectTypes SelectionFilterEnum
Input array of SelelctionFilterEnum values that indicate the type of objects to find. The
values are the enum values from the SelectionFilterEnum and can be combined to specify
multiple object types.
UseCylinder Boolean
Input argument that specifies if the vector defines a cylinder or cone when checking to see if
an entity is hit by the ray.
This is an optional argument whose default value is True.
ProximityTolerance Variant Optional input Double that specifies the tolerance value for the search. This value defines the
radius of a cylinder if UseCylinder is True or the angle of the cone if False. If not specified,

EntityTwo Object Input object that defines the second object. This object
can be a planar face, work plane, linear edge, work
axis, or a face that defines an axis.
Angle Variant
Input Variant that defines the angle between the two
input entities. This can be either a numeric value or a
string. A parameter for this value is created and the
supplied string or value is assigned to the parameter. If
a value is input, the units are radians. If a string is
input the units can be specified as part of the string or
will default to the current angle units of the document.
SolutionType AngleConstraintSolutionTypeEnum
Optional input AngleConstraintSolutionTypeEnum
that specifies the solution type. If specified to be
kDirectedSolution, the solution always applies the
right hand rule. If specified to be kUndirectedSolution,
the solution allows either orientation, thus resolving
situations where component orientation flips during a
constraint drive or drag. If specified to be
kReferenceVectorSolution, the ReferenceVectorEntity
argument must be provided with a third entity for the
solution. The default value is kDirectedSolution.

Input object that defines the second object and its translation axis. The input object must be a planar
Face, a revolved Face, a linear Edge, a WorkPlane, or a WorkAxis object. For planar objects the
translation axis is normal to the input face.
Ratio Variant
Input Variant that defines the distance of translation for every revolution of the rotated occurrence.
This can be either a numeric value or a string. A parameter for this value is created and the supplied
string or value is assigned to the parameter. If a value is input, the units are centimeters. If a string is
input the units can be specified as part of the string or will default to the current length units of the
document.
ForwardDirection Boolean
Input Boolean that defines the direction of translation with respect to the rotation direction relative
to the axes directions. If the input value is True then when the rotation object is rotated in a positive
direction about its axis, the translation object will move in the positive direction of its vector, If
False, it will move in the negative direction.
BiasPointOne Variant
Optional input Point object that is used help in determining the initial position of the occurrence.
The occurrences are repositioned in an attempt to make the two bias points coincident. This
provides some general control over the position of the occurrence when it isn't being controlled by
another constraint.
An example of when the bias points are useful is the case when the first constraint on a part is a
mate constraint. In the case where the mate is between two planes, the parts can be positioned
anywhere along the infinite plane that defines their mating contact. Using the bias points you can
define the position of the two occurrences, relative to each other.
If a bias point is not given, one is calculated that is at the center of the parameter range of the input
entity.
This is an optional argument whose default value is null.
